\chapter{Introduction}

\ds\ is a set of Fortran routine to make calculations for
supersymmetric dark matter in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model, the MSSM. The physics involved is covered in the \ds\ paper
\cite{dspaper}. In this manual we will mainly cover the more techincal
aspects of \ds, i.e.~ how to call different subroutines and how to
change switches and options. We will only briefly review the necessary
physics involved when needed and refer the reader to \cite{dspaper}
and the original papers behind \ds\ \cite{dsoriginal} for more
details. If you use \ds\, please consider the original physics work
behind and give proper credit to \cite{dspaper} and the relevant
references in \cite{dsoriginal}. If you use non-standard options,
e.g.\ a different propagation model for antiprotons, please remember
to give proper credit to that model.

\chapter{General remarks on notation}


In an attempt to keep this manual reasonably easy to follow we will
need to specify our notation.  We will use the following convention
for fonts,
\begin{sub}{Convention for fonts}
  \itv{\rmfamily text}{} This font is used for normal text.
  \itv{variable}{} This font is used for variables or other things
  in the code that is mentioned.
  \itv{\ftb{routine}}{} This font is used for subroutine or function
  names or for header file names.
  \itv{\tt dump}{} This font will be used for screen dumps of outputs.
  \itv{\ttfamily \em input}{} This font will be used for user
  input, i.e.\ where you are supposed to write something.
\end{sub}

Subroutines and functions will be described with the following
structure
\begin{sub}{subroutine \ftb{example}(in1,in2,in3,in4,in5,in6,in7,out1)}
  \itit{Purpose:} Here the routine will be explained.
  \itit{Inputs:}
  \itv{in1}{i} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{integer}.
  \itv{in2}{r} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{real}.
  \itv{in3}{r8} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{real*8}.
  \itv{in4}{c} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{complex}.
  \itv{in5}{c16} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{complex*16}.
  \itv{in6}{ch2} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{character*2}.
  \itv{in7}{ch*} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{character*(*)}.
  \itit{Outputs}
  \itv{out1}{r8} This is an output argument, declared as \ft{real*8}
\end{sub}
where the shorthand notation for the type of the arguments is
indicated. For functions, the type is indicated on the first line,
\begin{sub}{function \ftb{fun}(arg) \hfill r8}
  \itit{Purpose:} Here the function will be explained.
  \itit{Inputs:}
  \itv{arg}{i} This is an input argument, declared as \ft{integer}.
\end{sub}
i.e., in this case the function is declared as \ft{real*8}.

The subroutines always reside in a file with the
same name as the subroutine/function. Routines that belong together
are put in separate subdirectories in the \ft{src} directory. The different
subdirectories are
\begin{sub}{Subdirectories in src/}
  \itv{ac}{}     accelerator constraints
  \itv{an}{}     driver routines for neutralino and chargino annihilation
  \itv{an1l}{}   1-loop neutralino annihilation amplitudes
  \itv{anstu}{}  tree-level neutralino and chargino annihilation amplitudes
  \itv{dd}{}     direct detection and neutralino scattering
  \itv{ep}{}     positron fluxes from the halo
  \itv{ge}{}     general routines
  \itv{ha}{}     yields of halo annihilation products (from Pythia
                 simulations in vacuum)
  \itv{hm}{}     halo models
  \itv{hr}{}     driver routines for rates from the halo
  \itv{ini}{}    initialization routines
  \itv{mu}{}     neutrino and muon yields from the neutralino
                 annihilations in the Earth/Sun (from Pythia
                 simulations in medium)
  \itv{nt}{}     driver routines for rates and fluxes in neutrino telescopes
  \itv{pb}{}     antiprotons from annihilation in the halo
  \itv{rd}{}     relic density routines (general)
  \itv{rn}{}     driver routines for neutralino relic density
  \itv{su}{}     general MSSM routines, couplings, masses, etc.
  \itv{xcern}{}  routines from CERNLIB
  \itv{xcmlib}{} routines from CMLIB 
\end{sub}


Common blocks are all declared in header files in the \ft{inc}
directory. When discussing switches and parameters in common blocks we
will, instead of describing the common blocks in detail, 
mention which header file they reside in. If you want to access these
variables, you should then include the corresponding header
file. E.g., it can look like this
\begin{sub}{Example parameters in \ftb{headerfile.h}}
  \itit{Purpose:} Description of this set of variables.
  \itv{par1}{r8} Description of a \ft{real*8} parameter.
\end{sub}

\label{ch:src-ac}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Accelerator bounds}

\ds\ contains a set of routines to check if a given model is excluded by
accelerator constraints. These routines are called \ftb{dsacbnd[number]}. The
policy is that when we update \ds\ with new accelerator constraints, we keep
the old routine, and add a new routine with the last number incremented by one.
Which routine that is called is determined by calling \ftb{dsacset} with a
tag determining which routine to call. To check the accelerator constraints, 
then call \ftb{dsacbnd} which calls the right routine for you. Upon return,
\ftb{dsacbnd} returns an exclusion flag, \code{excl}. If zero, the model
is OK, if non-zero, the model is excluded. The cause for the exclusion is coded
in the bits of \code{excl} according to table \ref{tab:acexcl}


\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrcl} \hline
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\code{excl}} && \\ \cline{1-3}
Bit set & Octal value & Decimal value && Reason for exclusion \\ \hline

 2 &             4 &            4 && Squark mass \\
 3 &            10 &            8 && Slepton mass \\
 4 &            20 &           16 && Invisible $Z$ width \\
 5 &            40 &           32 && Higgs mass \\
 6 &           100 &           64 && Neutralino mass \\
 7 &           200 &          128 && $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ \\
 8 &           400 &          256 && $\rho$ parameter \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The bits of \code{excl} are set to indicate by which process this
particular model is excluded. Check if a bit is set with 
\code{btest(excl,bit)}.}

\chapter[an: Annihilation cross sections (general, $\chi^0$ and $\chi^\pm$) ]{\codeb{src/an}:\\ Annihilation cross sections (general, $\chi^0$ and $\chi^\pm$) }
\label{ch:src-an}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Annihilation cross sections -- theory }

For the relic density calculations, we need all possible
(co)annihilation cross sections between neutralinos, charginos and
sfermions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Annihilation cross sections}
\label{sec:AnnCross}

We have calculated all two-body final state cross sections at tree
level for involving netralinos, charginos, sneutrinos, sleptons and 
squarks in the initial state. A complete list is given below.

Since we have so many different diagrams contributing, we have to use 
some method where the diagrams can be calculated efficiently. To
achive this, we calculate the diagrams with general expressions for
vertices, masses etc so that they can be reused for other
processes. How we do this in practice differs a bit between different
sets of annihilation diagrams.

For neutralino-neutralino, neutralino-chargino and chargino-chargino
annihilation, we 
classify the diagrams according to their topology ($s$-, 
$t$- or $u$-channel) and to the spin of the particles involved.  We 
then compute the helicity amplitudes for each type of diagram 
analytically with {\sc Reduce}~\cite{reduce} using general expressions 
for the vertex couplings.  

The strength of the helicity amplitude method is that the analytical
calculation of a given type of diagram has to be performed only once
and the sum of the contributing diagrams for each set of initial and
final states can be done numerically afterwards.

For the diagrams involving sfermions, {\sc Form}
is used to analytically calculate the amplitudes. This output is then converted
into Fortran with a {\sc Perl} script, \codeb{form2f} \cite{form2f}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Coannihilation diagrams}

All Feynman diagrams for which we calculate the 
annihilation cross section are listed in the coming sections.
$s(x)$, $t(x)$ and $u(x)$ denote a
tree-level Feynman diagram in which particle $x$ is exchanged in
the $s$-, $t$- and $u$-channel respectively. 

The convention used in this list of included coannihilation diagrams is that if a sfermion is
denoted $\tilde{f}$, then it's antiparticle is denoted $\tilde{f}^*$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Neutralino and chargino annihilation}

Indices $i,j,k$ run
from 1 to 4, and indices $c,d,e$ from 1 to 2.  $u$, $\tilde{u}$,
$d$, $\tilde{d}$, $\nu$, $\tilde{\nu}$, $\ell$, $\tilde{\ell}$,
$f$ and $\tilde{f}$ are generic notations for up-type quarks,
up-type squarks, down-type quarks, down-type squarks, neutrinos,
sneutrinos, leptons, sleptons, fermions and sfermions.  A sum of
diagrams over (s)fermion generation indices and over the
neutralino and chargino indices $k$ and $e$ is understood (no sum
over indices $i,j,c,d$).

\subsection{Squark-squark annihilation}

We will here denote squarks as $\tilde{q}^i_a$ and $\tilde{q}^j_b$ where $i$ and
$j$ are the family indices and $a$ and $b$ are the mass eigenstate indices
(running from 1 to 2). $k$ and $l$ will also be used as family indices for processes including more squarks. Colour indices are suppressed. $\tilde{u}^i$ is used as a
generic notation for any up-type squark where $i$ denotes the family index. Down-type 
squarks are denoted analogously.

Note that we will not (except in rare occations) show processes for $\tilde{\nu}$
and $\tilde{\ell}$ separately since they can easily be obtained from the squark
processes by replacing $\tilde{u}$ with $\tilde{\nu}$ and 
$\tilde{d}$ with $\tilde{\ell}$ (and noting that we only have one mass eigenstate
for the $\tilde{\nu}$. Also note that the $\tilde{\nu}-\tilde{\ell}$--sector
is assumed not to be flavour-changing.

\subsection{Degrees of freedom}

We have to be careful with the internal degrees of freedom, $g$, of
the particles. We can either treat e.g.\ a $\chi_i^+$ and a $\chi_i^-$ as
two separate particles with two degrees of freedom each, or we can
treat them as one particle $\chi_i^\pm$ with four degrees of
freedom. The latter approach has an advantage that we
simplify our expressions for the effective annihilation
cross sections when coannihilations are needed. Hence, we use that
approach here. For a more detailed discussion about this, see Section
\ref{sec:dof}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Annihilation routines - general remarks}

The annihilation cross section routines is divided into several parts,
mostly for historical reasons. The layout is roughly as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item{\code{src/an}} Here we keep the main routins for both neutralino-
  neutralino annihilation cross sections and the effective annihilation
  cross section in the relic density calculations. The steering routines
  for neutralino and chargino coannihilations are also kept here.
  
\item{\code{src/anstu}} Here keep the $t-$, $u-$ and $s-$ diagram expressions
for fermion-fermion coannihilations (i.e.\ neutralino and chargino
coannihilations).

\item{\code{src/as}} Here all the coannihilation cross sections including
sfermions are kept.

\end{description}

We will here describe the \code{src/an}-routines.


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General routines}

The general routine to call for an effective annihilation cross section (to
be used for relic density calculations) is \codeb{dsanwx}, which returns the
invariant annihilation rate (integrated over $\cos \theta$). The actual
cross section, differential in $\cos \theta$ is calculated by 
\codeb{dsandwdcos} which includes all the coannihilations needed. This is set
up in \codeb{rn/dsrdomega} which determines which coannhilating particles
to include.

For other applications where the annihilation rate is needed, e.g.\ annihilation
in the galactic halo, one can call the specific annihilation rate routine
directly. The main one is \codeb{dsandwdcosnn} for neutralino-neutralino
annihilation. To simplify this task, we supply a routine \codeb{dssigmav} which
calls \codeb{dsandwdcosnn} for neutralino-neutralino annihilation at zero
relative velocity and returns the result, either as the total annihilation
cross section, or the cross section for a specific channel. See the header of
\codeb{dssigmav} for details.

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Neutralino and chargino (co)annihilation cross sections}
                                   
The routines \codeb{dsandwdcosnn}, \codeb{dsandwdcoscn} and \codeb{dsandwdcoscc}
calculate the annihilation cross sections (returning the invariant 
annihilation rate) for neutralino-neutralino, neutralino-chargino and
chargino-chargino annihilations. Which particles the cross section is
calculated for is given by particle indices as defined in \codeb{inc/dssusy.h}.

All the annihilation routines return the invariant rate instead of the
cross section. The invariant annihilation rate between particle $i$
and $j$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
  W_{ij} = 4 p_{ij} \sqrt{s} \sigma_{ij} = 4 \sigma_{ij} \sqrt{(p_i
\cdot p_j)^2 - m_i^2 m_j^2} = 4 E_{i} E_{j} \sigma_{ij} v_{ij} .
\end{equation}
See chapter \ref{ch:src-rd} for more details.

\section{Annihilation cross sections at 1-loop -- general }

The annihilation cross sections at 1-loop that we have implemented in
\ds\ are those to $\gamma \gamma$, $Z \gamma$ and $g g$. The
derivation of these is described in the works \cite{ggullio,zgullio}.

To see how these routines are called, see the file
\codeb{src/an/dsandwdcosnn.f} where the $\gamma \gamma$, $Z \gamma$
and $g g$ contributions are added to the annihilation cross section at
the end.

\section{Annihilation amplitudes for fermion-fermion annihilation}

In this directory, all the helicity amplitudes needed for
neutralino-neutralino, neutralino-chargino and chargino-chargino
annihilation are calculated. The helicity amplitudes have been
calculated with general expressions for vertices, masses etc.\ in
\code{Reduce} and converted to Fortran files. The calculation of these
are described in more detail in \cite{edsjo97}.

Each routine here adds the contribution to the helicity amplitudes
from one particular diagram and the sum over contributed diagrams is
done in the routines \codeb{an/dsandwdcosnn}, \codeb{an/dsandwdcoscn}
and \codeb{an/dsandwdcoscc}. The naming convention for the routines
here is the following: The first part of the routine name is
\codeb{dsan} to indicate that they deal with annihilations in \ds. The
next character tells which kind of process it is $s$-, $t$- or
$u$-channel and the next two caracters tell which initial state
particles we have (\codeb{f} for fermion), the next character is the
kind of propagating particle (\codeb{f} for fermion, \codeb{s} for
scalar and \codeb{v} for vector boson), and finally, the last two
characters tell the kind of final state particles. So, to take an
example, the routine \codeb{dsansffsvv} calculates the helicity
amplitudes for annihilation of two fermions to two vector
bosons via $s$-channel exchange of a scalar. There are also a few
special cases (routines ending in \codeb{ex} or \codeb{in}) for
diagrams with clashing arrows.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Annihilation cross sections with sfermions -- general }

In this directory, all the (co)annihilation cross sections involving
one or more sfermions in the initial state are calculated. The code
here is based upon the work described in \cite{sfcoann}. All the cross
sections are calculated with \code{Form} and converted to Fortran with
a script \codeb{form2f} \cite{form2f}. 

The main routines here are

\begin{brief-subs}
\bsub{dsasdwdcossfsf}
  Calculates the invariant annihilation rate between two sfermions in
  the initial state.
\bsub{dsasdwdcossfchi}
  Calculates the invariant annihilation rate between one sfermion and
  one fermion (neutralino or chargino) in the iniital state.
\end{brief-subs}

\section{$b \rightarrow s \gamma$ -- theory}

The rare decay $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ can have large contributions
from loops of suersymmetric particles and one therefore has to check
that a particular supersymmetric model does not violate the observed
branching ratio for $b$ decay to $s \gamma$. In \ds\ we have several
expressions for calculations of the $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ decay. In
\codeb{ac/}, some older obsolte expressions are found (kept only for
historical reasons). In this directory, \codeb{bsg/}, we have our best
implementation of the $b \rightarrow s \gamma$ decay.

 Our estimate of this process includes the complete next-to-leading 
order (NLO) correction for the SM contribution and the dominant
NLO corrections for the SUSY term.  The NLO QCD SM calculation is performed
following the analysis in Ref.~\cite{bsgsm}, modified according to~\cite{bsgmagic}, 
and gives a branching ratio 
$\mathrm{BR}[B\rightarrow X_s\,\gamma] =3.72\times10^{-4}$ 
for a photon energy greater than  $m_b/20$. In the SUSY contribution, we 
include the NLO contributions in the two Higgs doublet model,
following~\cite{bsgh2}, and the corrections due to SUSY particles. The latter
are calculated under the assumption of minimal flavour violation, with the 
dominant LO contributions from Ref.~\cite{bsgtan}, and with the NLO QCD term
with expressions of \cite{bsgsusy} modified in the large $\tan\beta$ regime
according to~\cite{bsgtan}. In the mSUGRA framework
(see, e.g., ~\cite{bsgcompare}), the largest discrepancy 
between the LO and the NLO SUSY corrections are found for ${\rm sign}{\mu}>0$, 
large $\tan\beta$ and low values of $m_{1/2}$: in this case the SUSY 
contribution to the decay rate is negative, and the discrimination of models 
based on the NLO analysis is less restrictive than the one in the LO analysis.
We will assume as allowed range of branching ratios 
$2.0\times10^{-4}\leq\mathrm{BR}[B\rightarrow X_s\,\gamma] \leq4.6\times10^{-4}$,
which is obtained adding a theoretical uncertainty of $\pm0.5\times10^{-4}$ to the
experimental value quoted by the Particle Data Group 2002~\cite{pdg02}.

\section{$b \rightarrow s \gamma$ -- routines}

The main routine is \codeb{dsbsgammafull} which returns the $b
\rightarrow s \gamma$ branching ratio. The routine can calculate
either only the standard model contribution or also include the SUSY
contribution (which is of course the default when this routine is
called from \codeb{dsacbnd}). The reaming (large) set or routines are
the various contributions to the decay as given in the references
listed above.

\section{Anti-deuteron fluxes from annihilation in the halo}

The anti-deuteron fluxes are calculated here following the approach of
\cite{dbar}. This means that we calculate the anti-deuteron fluxes
based on a merging model of antiprotons and antineutrons in quark
jets. Apart from this, the anti-deuterons are propagated in the same
way as antiprotons.

\chapter[dd: Direct detection]{\codeb{src/dd}:\\ Direct detection}
\label{ch:src-dd}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Direct detection -- theory}

\paolo{WE MUST DECIDE WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THE DIRECT DETECTION ROUTINES.
   PRESENTLY, ONLY THE NEUTRALINO-PROTON AND NEUTRALINO-NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS
   SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH THE CROSS SECTIONS OFF NUCLEI ARE ON THE
   AGENDA, DO WE REALLY WANT TO MENTION THEM HERE?}

If  neutralinos are indeed the CDM needed on galaxy scales and larger,
there should be a substantial flux of these particles in the Milky
Way halo. Since the interaction strength  is
essentially given by the same weak couplings as, e.g., for neutrinos
there is a non-negligible chance of detecting them in low-background
counting experiments \cite{goodmanwitten}.
Due to the large parameter space of MSSM, even
with the simplifying assumptions above, there is a rather wide span of
predictions for the event rate in detectors of various types. It is
interesting, however, that the models giving the largest rates are
already starting to be probed by present direct detection
experiments \cite{bg,bottino}.


The rate for direct detection of galactic neutralinos, integrated over
deposited energy assuming no energy threshold, is
\begin{equation}
   R = \sum_i N_i n_\chi \langle \sigma_{i\chi} v \rangle ,
\end{equation}
where $ N_i $ is the number of nuclei of species $i$ in the detector,
$n_\chi$ is the local galactic neutralino number density, $
\sigma_{i\chi} $ is the neutralino-nucleus elastic cross section, and
the angular brackets denote an average over $ v $, the neutralino
speed relative to the detector as described in Section~\ref{sec:halo}.

In \ds, the basic quantities computed are the neutralino-nucleon cross
sections, which are free of complications related to nuclear
structure, and various experimental details like energy threshold,
efficiencies etc.  However, as a crude estimate of the expected rates
in realistic detectors, the total neutralino-nucleus scattering rates
can be obtained for $^{76}$Ge, Al$_2$O$_3$ (sapphire) and NaI.
Usually, it is the spin-independent interaction that gives the most
important contribution in target materials such as Na, Cs, Ge, I, or
Xe, due to the enhancement caused by the coherence of all nucleons in
the target nucleus.

The neutralino-nucleus elastic cross section can be written as
\begin{equation}
   \sigma_{i\chi} = {1 \over 4 \pi v^2 } \int_{0}^{4 m^2_{i\chi} v^2}
   \mbox{\rm d} q^2 G_{i\chi}^2(q^2) ,
\end{equation}
where $ m_{i\chi} $ is the neutralino-nucleus reduced mass, $q$ is the
momentum transfer and $G_{i\chi}(q^2) $ is the effective
neutralino-nucleus vertex. We write
\begin{equation}
   G^2_{i\chi}(q^2) = A_i^2 F^2_S(q^2) G_S^2 +
   4 \Lambda_i^2 F^2_A(q^2) G_A^2 ,
   \label{detrate1}
\end{equation}
which shows the coherent enhancement factor $A_i^2$ for the
spin-independent cross section
(often $ \Lambda_i^2 $ is written as $ \lambda^2 J(J+1) $ ). We assume
gaussian nuclear form factors \cite{Gould87} \paolo{WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY
   PROVIDING FORM FACTORS.} \comment{Use better form
factors?}
\begin{equation}
   F_S(q^2) = F_A(q^2) =
   \exp(-q^2R_i^2/6\hbar^2) ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   R_i = ( 0.3 + 0.89 A_i^{1/3} ) {\rm fm} ,
\end{equation}
which should provide us with a good approximation of the integrated
detection rate \cite{EllisFlores}, in which we are only interested.
(To obtain the differential rate with reasonable accuracy, better
approximations are needed \cite{engel}.)

Using heavy-squark effective lagrangians
\cite{efflagrange}, we get
\begin{equation}
   G_S = \sum_{q={\rm u,d,s,c,b,t}} \langle \bar{q} q \rangle
   \left( \sum_{h=H_1,H_2} { g_{h\chi\chi} g_{hqq} \over m_h^2 } -
   {1\over 2} \sum_{k=1}^6 { g_{L\tilde{q}_k\chi q} g_{R\tilde{q}_k\chi q} \over
   m^2_{\tilde{q}_k} } \right)
\label{GS}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}

Defining ($N=n,p$)
\beq
f^N_{Tq}\equiv {\langle N |m_q\bar q q|N\rangle\over m_N},

we take in \ds\ the numerical values \cite{Gasser}

   & f^p_{Tu} = 0.023, \qquad f^p_{Td} = 0.034, \qquad
    &\nonumber\\
&f^p_{Tc} = 0.0595, \qquad f^p_{Ts} = 0.14, \qquad&\nonumber\\
&f^p_{Tt} = 0.0595, \qquad f^p_{Tb}=0.0595 \qquad
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
   & f^n_{Tu} = 0.019, \qquad f^n_{Td} = 0.041, \qquad
    &\nonumber\\
&f^n_{Tc} = 0.0592 \qquad f^n_{Ts} = 0.14, \qquad&\nonumber\\
&f^n_{Tt} = 0.0592, \qquad f^n_{Tb} = 0.0592. \qquad
\end{eqnarray}

For the quark contributions to the nucleon spin we
take \cite{SMC}
\begin{equation}
   \Delta {\rm u} = 0.77, \qquad \Delta {\rm d} = -0.40, \qquad
   \Delta {\rm s} = -0.12 .
\end{equation}
However, the older set of data \cite{jaffe}
\begin{equation}
   \Delta {\rm u} = 0.77, \qquad \Delta {\rm d} = -0.49, \qquad
   \Delta {\rm s} = -0.15
\end{equation}
can optionally be used.

Moreover, we take for the $\Lambda$ factors
\begin{equation}
   \Lambda^2_{\rm Al} = 0.087, \qquad
   \Lambda^2_{\rm Na} = 0.041 \quad {\rm and} \quad
   \Lambda^2_{\rm I} = 0.007,
   \label{detrate2}
\end{equation}
according to the odd-group model \cite{EngelVogel}.

\label{ch:src-ep}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Positrons from the halo -- theory}

Neutralino annihilations in the halo will give rise to positrons either
directly or from decaying mesons in hadron jets.  We thus expect to get both
monochromatic positrons (at an energy of $m_{\chi}$) from direct annihilation
into $e^{+}e^{-}$ and continuum positrons from the other annihilation
channels. In general, the branching ratio for annihilation directly into $e^+
e^-$ is rather small due to the helicity-flip suppression $\propto m_e$ for
S-wave annihilation in the halo, but for some classes of models one can still
obtain a large enough branching ratio for the line to be observable.

The computation of the positron flux from neutralino annihilations used in \ds\
resembles the calculation of the antiproton flux, with some important changes
due to other mechanisms of energy loss with different energy dependence.  Due
to the fact that energy losses for positrons are more rapid than for
antiprotons, the computed signal is less sensitive to the global structure of
the dark matter halo.  (On the other hand, it is more sensitive to possible
local sources of background, such as supernova remnants etc.)

The calculation of the neutralino-induced positron flux performed in \ds\
follows the analysis in \cite{baltz}.  For continuum positrons, we have again
simulated the decay and/or hadronization with the Lund Monte Carlo {\sc Pythia}
as described in section \ref{sec:mcsim}.
%For any given MSSM model, the positron spectrum is
%\begin{equation}
%  \frac{d\phi}{dE} =
%  \left. \frac{d\phi}{dE} \right|_{\rm cont.} +
%  \left. \frac{d\phi}{dE} \right|_{\rm line}
%  = \sum_{F \neq e^{+}e^{-}} B_{F}
%  \left. \frac{d\phi}{dE} \right|_{F} + B_{e^{+}e^{-}}\,
%  \delta(E-m_\chi),
%\end{equation}
%in units of $e^{+}/{\rm annihilation}$ where $B_{F}$ is the branching ratio
%into a given final state $F$ and $\left.d\phi/dE\right|_{F}$ is the
%spectrum of positrons from annihilation channel $F$\@.
We have included all two-body final states in \ds\ (except the three lightest
quarks which are completely negligible) at tree level and the $Z\gamma$
\cite{bub} and $gg$ \cite{lp} final states which arise at one-loop level.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Propagation and the interstellar flux}

We consider a standard diffusion model, somewhat less
sophisticated than in the case of antiprotons, for the propagation of
positrons in the galaxy.  Charged particles move under the influence
of the galactic magnetic field.  For the relevant energies
  the magnetic gyroradii of the particles are quite small.
However, the magnetic field is tangled, and even with small gyroradii,
particles can jump to nearby field lines which will drastically alter
their courses.  This entire process can be modeled as a random walk,
which can be described by a diffusion equation.

Positron propagation is complicated by the fact that light particles lose
energy quickly due to inverse Compton and synchrotron processes.  Diffuse
starlight and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) both contribute appreciably
to the energy loss rate of high energy electrons and positrons via inverse
Compton scattering.  Electrons and positrons also lose energy by synchrotron
radiation as they spiral around the galactic magnetic field lines.

Our detailed treatment of positron diffusion employed in \ds\ is as follows.
First define a dimensionless energy variable $\varepsilon=E/(1\;{\rm GeV})$,
and the dimensionless mass $\mct=m_\chi/(1\;{\rm GeV})$\@.  The
standard diffusion-loss equation for the space density of cosmic rays per unit
energy, $dn/d\varepsilon$, is then given by
\begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}=\vec{\nabla}\cdot
   \left[K(\varepsilon,\vec{x})\vec{\nabla}\frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}\right]+
   \frac{\partial}{\partial \varepsilon}\left[b(\varepsilon,\vec{x})
   \frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}\right]+Q(\varepsilon,\vec{x}),
   \label{eq:diffloss}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the diffusion constant, $b$ is the energy loss rate and $Q$ is the
source term.  We consider only steady state solutions, setting the left hand
side of Eq.\ (\ref{eq:diffloss}) to zero.

We assume that the diffusion constant $K$ is constant in space throughout a
``diffusion zone'', but it may vary with energy.  At energies above a few GeV,
we can represent the diffusion constant as a power law in energy \cite{wlg},
\begin{equation}
   K(\varepsilon)=K_0\varepsilon^\alpha\approx
   3\times 10^{27}\varepsilon^{0.6}{\rm cm}^2\;{\rm s}^{-1}.
   \label{eq:KA}
\end{equation}
However, at energies below about 3 GeV, there is a cutoff in the diffusion
constant that can be modeled as
\begin{equation}
   K(\varepsilon)=K_0\left[C+\varepsilon^\alpha\right]\approx
   3\times 10^{27}\left[3^{0.6}+\varepsilon^{0.6}\right]
   {\rm cm}^2\;{\rm s}^{-1}.
   \label{eq:KB}
\end{equation}
Both of these models for the diffusion constant can be used in \ds\ but the
second expression is the default.\footnote{In fact, a third option can be
   chosen in \ds\ as well, employing the propagation model of \cite{kamturner}.}
The function $b(\varepsilon)$ represents the (time) rate of energy loss.  We
allow energy loss via synchrotron emission and inverse Compton scattering.  The
rms magnetic field in the diffusion zone is about $3~\mu$G, an energy density
of about 0.2 eV cm$^{-3}$\@. We allow inverse Compton scattering on both the
cosmic microwave background and diffuse starlight, which have energy densities
of 0.3 and 0.6 eV cm$^{-3}$ respectively.  These two processes combined give an
energy loss rate \cite{energy-loss} \def\erf{\mathop{\rm erf}}
\begin{equation}
   b(\varepsilon)_{e^\pm}=\frac{1}{\taue}\varepsilon^2
   \approx 10^{-16}\varepsilon^2\;{\rm s}^{-1},
   \label{eq:bofe}
\end{equation}
where we have neglected the space dependence of the energy loss rate.  Lastly,
the function $Q$ is the source of positrons in units of cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$\@.

We model the diffusion zone as a slab of thickness $2L$\@.  We fix $L$ to be 3
kpc, which fits observations of the cosmic ray flux \cite{wlg}.  We impose free
escape boundary conditions, namely that the cosmic ray density drops to zero on
the surfaces of the slab, which we let be the planes $z=\pm L$\@.  We neglect
the radial boundary usually considered in diffusion models.  This is justified
when the sources of cosmic rays are nearer than the boundary, as is usually the
case with galactic sources.  We will see that the positron flux at Earth,
especially at higher energies, mostly originates within a few kpc and hence
this approximation is well justified in our case. (This is different from the
case of antiprotons, where the flux from the Galactic center can be very
important at the Earth's location \cite{pbar}.)
%From \cite{baltz} we find the solution to the diffusion equation
%\begin{equation}
%  \frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}=\frac{\taue}{\varepsilon^2}\int
%  ^\infty_\varepsilon d\varepsilon'\,\int d^3\vec{x}\,'\,G_{2L}
%  \left(v(\varepsilon)-v(\varepsilon'),\vec{x}-\vec{x}\,'\right)
%  Q(\varepsilon',\vec{x}\,').
%  \label{eq:dnde}
%\end{equation}
%where the function $G_{2L}$ is the Green's function for a slab with thickness
%$2L$, satisfying the free escape boundary conditions\@.
%The free space Green's function is given by
%\begin{equation}
%G_{\rm free}(v-v',\vec{x}-\vec{x}\,')=\left(4\pi K_0\taue\deltav\right)^{-3/2}
%\exp\left(-\frac{\left(\vec{x}-\vec{x}\,'\right)^2}{4K_0\taue\deltav}\right)
%\theta(\deltav).
%\end{equation}
%With image charges $x_n=x$, $y_n=y$, $z_n=2Ln+(-1)^nz$, the full Green's
%function is
%\begin{equation}
%G_{2L}(v-v',\vec{x}-\vec{x}\,')=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty
%(-1)^nG_{\rm free}(v-v',\vec{x}-\vec{x}_n').
%\end{equation}
The spatial part of the Green's function is performed once, independently of
the supersymmetric model, yielding an energy dependent diffusion time
\begin{equation}
\taud(\varepsilon,\varepsilon')=\frac{1}{4K_0\deltav}
\sum^\infty_{n=-\infty}\sum_\pm\erf\left(\frac{(-1)^nL+2Ln\pm z}
{\sqrt{4K_0\taue\deltav}}\right)\times\hspace{1in}
\end{equation}
\begin{displaymath}
\int_0^\infty dr'\,r'f(r')
I_0\left(\frac{2rr'}{4K_0\taue\deltav}\right)
\exp\left(\frac{r^2+r'^2}{4K_0\taue\deltav}\right)
\theta(\deltav),
\end{displaymath}
where $f(r)$ is the effective halo profile squared, and the expression is
evaluated for $r$ and $z$ appropriate for the observer.  The function
$v(\varepsilon)$ depends on the diffusion model: the default model has
$v(\varepsilon)=C/\varepsilon+\varepsilon^{\alpha-1}/(1-\alpha)$.  The function
$\taud$ is the effective diffusion time for particles emitted at energy
$\varepsilon'$ and observed at energy $\varepsilon$.  Of course if the
observed energy is larger than the emitted energy, $\taud=0$.  The spatial
integrand is smooth, and is computed for a range of values, equally spaced in
$\log(\deltav)$\@ for use in \ds.  Likewise, the series of image charges used
in the Green's function converges rapidly, and with the range of
$\deltav$ values we are concerned with, need not be taken past $n=\pm 10$\@.
The total positron spectrum is now given by
\begin{equation}
   \frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}=n_0^2\sigv\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigg\{B_{\rm
   line}\taud
   \left(\varepsilon,\mct\right)+\int_{\varepsilon}^{\mct}d\varepsilon'\,
   \left.\frac{d\phi}{d\varepsilon}\right|_{\rm
   cont.}\taud(\varepsilon,\varepsilon') \Bigg\},
\label{eq:dndefinal}
\end{equation}
where $B_{\rm line}$ is the branching ratio directly to $e^+e^-$, and
$d\phi/d\varepsilon|_{\rm cont.}$ is the spectrum of continuum positrons per
annihilation.  Remembering that this is an expression for the number density of
positrons, the flux is given by
\begin{equation}
   \frac{d\Phi}{d\varepsilon} = \frac{\beta c}{4 \pi} \frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}
   \simeq \frac{c}{4 \pi} \frac{dn}{d\varepsilon},
\end{equation}
where $\beta c$ is the velocity of a positron of energy
$\varepsilon$\@.  For the energies we are interested in, $\beta c
\simeq c$ is a very well justified approximation.

%The integral is performed in the variable $v$\@ (see \cite{baltz} 
%for details).
%Replacing the Jacobian factor $w(v)=-d\varepsilon/dv$, one finds
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{dn}{d\varepsilon}=n_0^2\sigv\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigg\{B_{\rm line}
%\taud\left(\varepsilon,\mct\right)+\int_{v(\mct)}^{v(\varepsilon)}dv'\,
%w(v')\left.\frac{d\phi}{d\varepsilon}\right|_{\rm cont.}
%\left(\varepsilon(v')\right)
%\taud\left(\varepsilon,\varepsilon(v')\right)\Bigg\}.
%\end{equation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Solar modulation}

Again there is a complication in that interactions with the solar wind and
magnetosphere, solar modulation, alter the spectrum.  This can be neglected at
high energies, but at energies below about 10 GeV, the effects of solar
modulation become important. However, its effects can be reduced by considering
the positron fraction, $e^+/(e^+ + e^-)$, instead of the absolute positron
fluxes. This is possible to obtain from \ds, since included in the package is
an estimate of the background $e^+$ and $e^-$ flux taken from
\cite{MoskStrong98}.

\label{ch:src-ha}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Annihilation in the halo, yields -- theory}

Here we calculate yields from annihilation in the halo.

\subsection{Monte Carlo simulations}
\label{sec:ha-mcsim}

We need to
evaluate the yield of different particles per neutralino annihilation.
The hadronization and/or decay of the annihilation products are
simulated with {\sc Pythia} \cite{pythia} 6.154.
The simulations are done for a set of 18 neutralino
masses, $m_{\chi}$ = 10, 25, 50, 80.3, 91.2, 100, 150, 176, 200, 250,
350, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 5000 GeV\@. We tabulate the
yields and then interpolate these tables in \ds.

     The simulations are here
     simpler than those for annihilation in the Sun/Earth
    since we don't have a surrounding medium that can stop the
     annihilation products.  We here simulate for 8 `fundamental'
     annihilation channels $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$,
     $t\bar{t}$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $W^+W^-$, $Z^0 Z^{0}$, $g g$ and
     $\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$. Compared to the simulations in the Earth and
     the Sun, we now let pions and kaons decay and we also let
     antineutrons decay to antiprotons. For each mass we simulate
     $2.5 \times 10^{6}$ annihilations and tabulate the yield of
     antiprotons, positrons, gamma rays (not the gamma lines),
     muon neutrinos and neutrino-to-muon conversion rates and the
     neutrino-induced muon yield, where in the last two cases the
     neutrino-nucleon interactions has been simulated with {\sc
     Pythia} as outlined in section~\ref{sec:nt-mcsim}

With these simulations, we can calculate the yield for any of these
particles for a given MSSM model.  For the Higgs bosons, which decay
in flight, an integration over the angle of the decay products with
respect to the direction of the Higgs boson is performed.  Given the
branching ratios for different annihilation channels it is then
straightforward to compute the muon flux above any given energy
threshold and within any angular region around the Sun or the center
of the Earth.

\label{ch:src-hm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Halo models -- theory}
\label{sec:halo}

All the dark matter detection rates depend in one way or another on
the properties of the Milky Way dark matter halo. We will here outline
the halo model that by default is included with \ds.

The mass distribution in the Milky Way and the relative importance of
\mbox{its} three components, the bulge, the disk and the halo, are
poorly constrained by available observational data.  Although the
dynamics of the satellites of the galaxy clearly indicates the
presence of a non-luminous matter component, a discrimination among
the different radial dark matter halo profiles proposed in the
literature is not possible at the time being ~\cite{binney}.  One
approach is to assume that dark matter profiles are of a universal
functional form and to infer the Milky Way dark matter distribution
from the results of N-body simulations of hierarchical clustering in
cold dark matter cosmologies.  The predicted profiles in these
scenarios have been tested to a sample of dark matter dominated dwarf
and low-surface brightness galaxies which provide the best
opportunities to test the spatial distribution of dark matter.
Actually this field of research is in rapid evolution and slightly
discrepant results have recently been presented
\cite{navarro,carlberg,kravtsov,moore}.

In \ds, we include a dark matter halo profile of the form
\beq
   \rho(r) \propto \frac{1}{(r/a)^{\gamma}\;[1+(r/a)^{\alpha}]^
   {(\beta-\gamma)/\alpha}}.
\eeq
With this family of profiles, we have a parameterization of most
spherically symmetric profiles
in the literature. In Table~\ref{tab:halo-profile} we list the
corresponding values of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for some
popular profiles.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
{\bfseries Model} & {\bfseries $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$}
& {\bfseries $a$ (kpc)} \\ \hline
Isothermal sphere \cite{kravtsov} & $(2,2,0)$ \\
Kravtsov et al.\ \cite{kravtsov} & $(2,3,0.2-0.4)$ \\
Navarro, Frenk and White\ \cite{navarro} & $(1,3,1)$ \\
Moore et al.\ \cite{moore} & $(?,?,?)$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Different halo dark matter profiles and their corresponding
parameters. \comment{Include $a$-values here as well?!?}}
\label{tab:halo-profile}
\end{center}
\end{table}

One should keep in mind that some of these profiles are very steep at
the center of the galaxy which might be in conflict with observations.
In fact, this is a topic under rapid evolution at present.  Some
researchers have taken the view that the steep profiles seen in
simulations are impossible to match with observations, and therefore
drastic modifications of the cold dark matter scenario have been
proposed.  Examples are self-interacting \cite{self} or strongly
self-annihilating \cite{annihil} dark matter models.  None of these
proposals can be made to work in MSSM models, so we do not consider
them in \ds.  It should also be noted that there could be other,
astrophysics-related solutions to these problems, which involve the
interplay between the baryons and the dark matter.

Our galactocentric distance $R_{0}$ is not entirely known. Estimates
for $R_{0}$ range from 7.1 kpc to 8.5 kpc \cite{oll,reid,???} and in
\ds\ we use $R_{0}=8.5$ kpc as a default. \comment{Check $R_{0}$
default. (JE)} We also choose the modified isothermal distribution as
a default, but this can be changed by the user.

As a further uncertainty, it is unknown precisely how the black hole
at the galactic center would have interacted with the halo neutralino
distribution. In fact, there are indications that a profile more
singular than NFW would cause a very steep cusp (a ``spike'')
near the Galactic center, with a high enough density that even
the flux of neutrinos from that population could be detected \cite{gs}.
If this really exists, essentially all MSSM models may already be excluded
through the non-detection of radio emission from electrons and
positrons generated in the annihilations \cite{spike}. It should be
noted though that these estimates involve many uncertainties.

We only consider spherical profiles; introducing a flattening
parameter may enhance the value of the flux but the effect is not
expected to be dramatic for this neutralino detection method and we
prefer not to introduce another factor of uncertainty.

We also need to specify the normalization constant of the halo
profile, which we choose as the value of the halo density $\rho_0$ at
our galactocentric distance $R_0$, the core radius $a$ and $R_0$.  One
should keep in mind that there is correlation between the allowed
values of $a$ and $\rho_{0}$ and the chosen halo profile
\cite{bub,pierothesis} due to constraints on e.g.\ the total mass of
the galaxy within 100 pc and the dark matter contribution to the local
rotation curve.  In Table~\ref{tab:halo-profiles} we list typical
values of $a$ and $\rho_{0}$ that we have chosen  based on
these constraints for the different profiles. For more details about these
arguments, see \cite{bub,pierothesis}. The \ds\ default value for
$\rho_{0}$ is 0.3 GeV/cm$^3$.

Usually, the local galactic dark matter velocity distribution is taken
to be a truncated gaussian, which in the detector frame moving at
speed $v_O$ relative to the galactic halo reads
\begin{equation}
   f(v) = {1\over {\mathcal N}_{\rm cut}} { v^2 \over u v_O \sigma} \left\{
   \exp\left[{-{(u-v_O)^2\over2\sigma^2}}\right] -
   \exp\left[{-{\min(u+v_O,v_{\rm cut})^2\over2\sigma^2}}\right]
   \right\}
\end{equation}
for $ v_{\rm esc} < v < \sqrt{v_{\rm esc}^2 + (v_O + v_{\rm cut} ) ^2
} $ and zero otherwise, with $ u = \sqrt{v^2 + v_{\rm esc}^2} $ and
\begin{equation}
   {\mathcal N}_{\rm cut} =
   {v_{\rm cut}\over\sigma} \exp\left( {-{v_{\rm cut}^2\over2\sigma^2}} \right)
   -
   \sqrt{\pi\over2} {\rm erf} \left( {v_{\rm cut}\over\sqrt{2}\sigma} \right) .
\end{equation}
As default, we have taken the halo line-of-sight (one-dimensional) velocity
dispersion $\sigma = $120 km/s,\footnote{Other authors write
   $\exp(-3v^2/2\overline{v}^2)$, in which case $\overline{v} = \sqrt{3}
   \sigma$.}  the galactic escape speed $ v_{\rm cut} = $ 600 km/s, the relative
Earth-halo speed $ v_O = $ 264 km/s (a yearly average) and the Earth escape
speed $ v_{\rm esc} = $ 11.9 km/s. These parameters can be changed by
the user. In some instances, like neutralino capture in the
Earth, the user can specify an arbitrary velocity distribution by
providing a subroutine.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Rescaling of the neutralino density}
\label{sec:rescale}

It is natural to assume that the neutralinos make up most of the dark
matter in our galaxy.  One may therefore only consider MSSM models
which are cosmologically interesting, i.e.\ where the neutralinos can
make up a major fraction of the dark matter in the Universe without
overclosing it.  This range is usually chosen to be $0.025 <
\Omega_{\chi}h^{2} <1$.  However, the user may want to either enlarge
or narrow this range.  If, as is perhaps most natural, the neutralino
alone contributes the major fraction of non-baryonic dark matter in
the Universe, one may want to refer to the current values of
cosmological parameters and fix $\Omega_{\chi}h^{2}$ to be in the
interval between, say 0.1 and 0.3.  If there are other components of
the dark matter, one may want to tolerate smaller numbers.  If one
makes use of the poor knowledge of how galaxy halos were formed, all
the range down to 0.025 may be taken as acceptable.  However, if
$\Omega_{\chi}h^{2}$ drops below 0.025, it cannot account for all the
dark matter associated with galaxy halos.  A frequently used recipe is
then to rescale the estimated local dark matter density $\rho_0\sim
0.3$ GeV/cm$^3$ by $\Omega_{\chi}h^2/0.025$, giving a lower local
density in the form of neutralinos.  Although this may seem a harmless
procedure, one should keep in mind that it is very {\em ad hoc} and
that it may overestimate the preponderance of models with large direct
detection rates.  This is because of the general result that
$\Omega_{\chi}h^{2}\sim 1/\sigma_{ann}v$, and crossing symmetry
generally relates a large annihilation cross section to a large
scattering cross section.  (For indirect detection in the halo, the
effect is moderated by the fact that the rates are proportional to the
square of the density, which thus involves the square of the rescaling
factor.)  In \ds, the user can set the value of the local dark matter
density (the default is $0.3$ GeV/cm$^3$) and determine whether
rescaling is to be used or not, and in that case the lowest tolerable
$\Omega^{\rm min}_{\chi}h^{2}$ below which rescaling should take
place.  If rescaling is used, all output detection rates are computed
with the rescaled value when appropriate.

\section{Gamma rays from the halo -- theory}

Among the yields of pair annihilations of halo dark matter particles,
the role played by gamma-rays could be a major one. Unlike the cases
involving charged particles, for gamma-rays it is straightforward
to relate the distribution of sources and the expected flux
at the earth. Most flux estimated can be obtained just by summing
over the contributions along 
lines of sight (or better, geodesics): gamma-rays have a low 
enough cross section on gas and dust and therefore the Galaxy is 
essentially transparent to them (except perhaps in the innermost part, 
very close to the region where a massive black hole is inferred); 
absorption by starlight and infrared background becomes effecient
only for very far away sources (redshift larger than about 1).

It follows that in case the gamma-ray signal is detectable, 
this might be the only chance for mapping the fine structure of a dark 
halo, with a much better resolution for inomogenities (clumps) with 
respect what is accevable through dynamical measurements or lensing effects. 
Turning the latter argument around, if the fine structure of the Galactic 
halo is clumpy, or if a large density enhancement is present towards the 
Galactic center, as seen in N-body simulations of dark matter halos,
this dark matter detection tecnique is much more promising than indicated 
by the earliest estimates in which smooth non-singular halo 
scenarios were considered (recall that the fluxes per unit volume are 
proportional to the square of the dark matter density locally in space).

A further reason to examine in details this detection methods is that
we are approaching what will probably be the golden age for
gamma-ray observations, with a several new experiments that are going 
to map the gamma-ray sky. These experiments will have unprecendented 
sensitivities and cover an energy range, namely 10 GeV -- few hundred GeV, 
in which very scarce data are available at the time being and which may 
turn out to be the most interesting for dark matter detection.
The hypothesis of a gamma-ray signal from neutralino annihilations 
will be tested for both by the upcoming space experiments 
(GLAST, AMS, AGILE) and by the new generation of ground-based 
air cherenkov telescopes (ACTs) being built (Magic, Hess, Veritas).

The bulk of the gamma-ray yield from neutralino annihilations arise in the
decay of neutral pions produced in the fragmetation processes initiated
by tree level final states~\cite{oldcontga,lpj,gahalo}
(analogously to the other halo signals,
in \ds\ we include all tree level final states and make use of a
Monte Carlo simulation for fragmentation and decay processes, see 
Section~\ref{sec:mcsim}). Unfortunately the $\pi^0$ 
intermediate state is common to other astrophysical processes, and this
may turn out to be a limiting factor to disentangle dark matter sources.
At the same time, however, a relevant gamma-ray contribution may arise 
directly (at one-loop level) in two body final states; although such 
photons are much fewer than those from $\pi^0$ decays they have a much 
better signature: neutralinos annihilating in the galactic halos move 
with a velocity of the order $v/c \sim$ 10$^{-3}$, hence these outgoing 
photons (as any particle in any of the allowed two body final states)
will then be nearly monochromatic, with energy of the order of the
neutralino mass\cite{charm,oldlines,jkline,lp,ub,lpj}. 
There is no other known astrophysical source with such a signature:
the detection of a line signal out of a spectrally smooth gamma-ray 
background would be a spectacular confirmation of the existence of dark 
matter in form of exotic massive particles.

If dark matter is in form of neutralinos, there are two processes
givin rise to line signals, the annihilation into two photons and into
one photon and a Z boson. Both of them are included in the \ds\ 
package, as well as the contribution with a continuum energy spectrum.
We review them briefly here, focussing first on annihilation rates
and giving then expressions for gamma-ray fluxes.


\subsection{$\chi\chi\to \gamma\gamma$}

In \ds\ the full expression for the annihilation cross section of
the process
\beq
\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} + \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} \rightarrow \gamma
+\gamma
\eeq
is computed at full one loop level, in the limit of vanishing relative 
velocity of the neutralino pair, i.e. the case of interest for neutralinos
in galactic halos; the outgoing photons have an energy equal to 
the mass of ${\chi}^{0}_{1}$:
\beq
E_{\gamma} = M_{\chi}.
\eeq
The neutralino pair must be in an S wave state with pseudoscalar quantum 
numbers; projecting out of the amplitude the $^{1}$S$_{0}$ state
simplifies the calculation, and a further simplification is obtained by
computing the amplitude in the non linear gauge defined in~\cite{fujikawa}, 
which is a slight variant of the usual linear R-gauge (or 't Hooft gauge). 

The amplitude of the annihilation process can be factorized in the
form
\beq
\mathcal{A} =\frac{e^2}{2 \sqrt{2} \; \pi^2}
  \epsilon\left(\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_{2},k_{1},k_{2} \right)
  \;\tilde{\mathcal{A}}
\eeq
where $\epsilon_{1}$, $\epsilon_{2}$ and $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$ are
respectively the polarization tensors and the momenta of the two outgoing 
photons. The cross section is then given, as a function of
$\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$, by the formula
\beq
  v\sigma_{2\gamma} = \frac{\alpha^2 M^2_{\chi}}{16 \pi^3} \left|\;
\tilde{\mathcal{A}}\; \right|^{2}\;\;\;.  \label{eq:sigmav2g}
\eeq

The total amplitude is implemented in \ds\ as the sum of the contributions 
obtained from four different classes of diagrams:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tilde{\mathcal{A}}=\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{f\tilde{f}}+
  \tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{H^+}+\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{W}+\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{G},
\end{eqnarray*}
where the indices label the particles in the internal loops, i.e.,
respectively, fermions and sfermions, charged Higgs and charginos, 
W-bosons and charginos, and, in the gauge we chose, charginos and Goldstone 
bosons. For every $\mathcal{A}$ term, real
and imaginary parts are splitted; the full set of analytic formulas are 
given in \cite{lp}, following the notation of \cite{linejk}, where some of 
the contributions were first computed. They are rather lengthy expressions
with non trivial dependences on various combinations of parameters in 
the MSSM. We reproduce here, as an example, the formulas for the diagrams
with W bosons and charginos, which, in  most cases, give the dominant 
contribution to the cross section as discovered in \cite{lp}. The sum over
$\chi^+_i$ includes the two chargino eigenstates:
\begin{eqnarray}
Re\,\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{W} & = &
\sum_{\chi^+_i} \frac{1}{M^2_{\chi}} \; \left[ 2\;
\frac{\left(a-b\right)\;
  S_{\chi W}}{1+a-b} \;I_{1} \left( a,b \right)+\frac{S_{\chi W}-2
\sqrt{a}\;
  D_{\chi W}}{1-a-b} \;I_{1} \left( a,1 \right) \right. \nonumber \\
   &&\left. + \left( 2\;\frac{S_{\chi W}-2 \sqrt{a}\;D_{\chi
W}}{1-a-b}-
    \frac{3\,S_{\chi W}-4 \sqrt{a}\;D_{\chi W}}{1-b}  \right)\;I_{2}
    \left( a,b \right) \right. \nonumber \\
   && \left.+ \left( \frac{\left(2+b\right)\,S_{\chi W}-4 \sqrt{a}\;
    D_{\chi W}}{1-b} -2\;\frac{\left( 1-a+b \right)\; S_{\chi
W}}{1+a-b}
    \right)\;I_{3}\left( a,b \right) \right]
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
Im\,\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_{W} & = &
  -\pi\;\sum_{\chi^+_i} \frac{1}{M^2_{\chi}} \; \left( 2\;
   \frac{\left(a-b\right)\;S_{\chi W}}{1+a-b} \right) \cdot \nonumber
\\
  &&\cdot \, \log \left( \frac{1+\sqrt{1-b/a}}{1-\sqrt{1-b/a}} \right)
   \theta \left(1-m^2_{W}\,/\,M^2_{\chi} \right) \label{imw}
\end{eqnarray}
where we defined:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a=\frac{M^2_{\chi^0_1}}{M^2_{\chi^+_i}} &&
b=\frac{m^2_{W}}{M^2_{\chi^+_i}}
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
S_{\chi W}=\frac{1}{2}\;\left(g^L_{W1i}\;
g^{L\,\ast}_{W1i}+g^R_{W1i}\;
  g^{R\,\ast}_{W1i} \right) && D_{\chi W}=\frac{1}{2}\;\left(
g^L_{W1i}\;
  g^{R\,\ast}_{W1i}+g^R_{W1i}\; g^{L\,\ast}_{W1i} \right)\;\; ,
\end{eqnarray*}
and the functions $I_{1}\left( a,b \right)$,
$I_{2}\left( a,b \right)$ and $I_{3}\left( a,b \right)$, which arise
from the loop integrations, are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{1}\left( a,b \right) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{d\,x}{x} \; \log \left(
\left|
\frac{4\,a\,x^2-4\;a\,x + b}{b} \right| \right)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{2}\left( a,b \right) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{d\,x}{x} \; \log \left(
\left|
\frac{-a\,x^2+(a+b-1)\,x + 1}{a\,x^2+(-a+b-1)\,x + 1} \right| \right)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{3}\left( a,b \right) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{d\,x}{x} \; \log \left(
\left|
\frac{-a\,x^2+(a+1-b)\,x + b}{a\,x^2+(-a+1-b)\,x + b} \right| \right) .
\end{eqnarray}
$I_{1}\left( a,b \right)$ is the well known three point function that
appears in triangle diagrams; it is an analytic function of
a/b. $I_{2}\left( a,b \right)$ and $I_{3}\left( a,b \right)$ may be
expressed in terms of dilogarithms. In \ds, they are computed in the
integral form as, for any physically interesting value of the
parameters a and b, the integrands are smooth functions of $x$.

The branching ratio for neutralino annihilations into $2\gamma$ is 
typically not larger than 1\%, with the largest values of
$v\sigma_{2\gamma}$, for neutralinos with a cosmologically significant
relic aboundance, in the range $10^{-29}$--$10^{-28}$~cm$^3$s$^{-1}$.
Such values may be large enough for the discovery of this signal
in upcoming measurements; at the same time it should be kept in mind
that very low values for the cross section are feasible as well.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\chi\chi\to Z\gamma$}

The process of neutralino annihilation into a photon and a Z$^0$ boson
\cite{ub}
\beq
\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} + \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} \rightarrow \gamma
+ Z^0
\eeq
also gives a nearly
monochromatic line (with a small smearing caused by the finite
  width of the $Z^0$ boson), with  energy
\beq
E_{\gamma} = M_{\chi} - \frac{m_Z^2}{4\,M_{\chi}}.
\eeq

The steps followed in \ds\
to compute the cross section are essentially the same
as those described for the  $2\gamma$ case.
Again the total amplitude is obtained by summing the contribution
from four classes of diagrams and by splitting for each of them 
real and imaginary parts. The analytic formulas were derived in 
\cite{ub}, and are much less compact than those 
obtained for the process of neutralino annihilation into two photons.

The maximum value of $v\sigma_{Z\gamma}$, for neutralinos with a 
cosmologically significant relic aboundance, is around 
$2\cdot 10^{-28}$~cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ and occurs for a nearly
pure Higgsinos. In the heavy mass range, the value of $v\sigma_{Z\gamma}$
reaches a plateau of around $0.6 \cdot 10^{-28}$~cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. This
interesting effect of a non-diminishing cross section with higgsino mass
(which is due to a contribution to the real part of the amplitude)
is also valid for the $2\gamma$ final state in the corresponding limit, 
with a value of $1\cdot 10^{-28}$~cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ \cite{lp}.
Since the gamma-ray background drops rapidly with increasing photon
energy, these processes may be interesting for detecting dark
matter neutralinos near the upper range of allowed neutralino masses.

Whenever the lightest neutralino contain a significant Wino or Higgsino
component the value of $v\sigma_{Z\gamma}$ maybe as large as, or even larger 
than, twice the value of $v\sigma_{2\gamma}$. It is therefore usually
not a good approximation to neglect the $Z\gamma$ state compared to
$2\gamma$.

\subsection{Gamma rays with continuum energy spectrum}

The advantage with the gamma-ray lines discussed in the previous Sections
is the distinctive spectral signature, which has no plausible astrophysical
counterpart. 

Compared to the monochromatic flux, the gamma-ray flux produced in 
$\pi^0$ decays is much larger but has less distinctive features.
The photon spectrum in the process of a pion decaying into $2\gamma$ is, 
independent of the pion energy, peaked at half of the $\pi^0$ mass, 
about 70~MeV, and symmetric with respect to this peak if plotted in 
logaritmic variables. Of course, this is true both for pions produced in 
neutralino annihilations and, e.g., for those generated by cosmic ray 
protons interacting with the interstellar medium.

When considered together with to the cosmic ray induced Galactic gamma-ray
background, the neutralino induced signal looks like a component analogous
to the secondary flux due to nucleon nucleon interactions: it is
drowned into the Bremsstrahlung component at low energy, while it may 
be the dominant contribution at energies above 1 GeV or so. 
In fact, if the exotic component is indeed significant
an option to disentangle it would be to search for a break in the
energy spectrum at about the neutralino mass, where the line feature
might be present as well: while the maximal energy for a photon emitted 
in neatralino pair annihilations is equal to the neutralino mass,
the component from cosmic ray protons extends to much higher energies,
essentially with the same spectral index as for the proton spectrum
(the role played by the third main background component, 
inverse Compton emission, has still to settled at the time being and
may worsen the problem of discrimitation against background).

Besides this (weak) spectral feature, another way to disentangle
the dark matter signal may be to exploit a directional signature:
data with a wide angular coverage should be analyzed to seach for 
a gamma-ray flux component following the shape and density profile 
of the dark halo, including eventual contributions from clumps.


\subsection{Sources and fluxes}

Given a density distribution of dark matter neutralinos along some line
of sight $l$, the monochromatic gamma-ray flux per unit solid
angle in that direction is:
\beq
{d\Phi_{\gamma}(\psi)\over d\Omega} 
= \frac{N_{\gamma}\;v\sigma_{X^0\gamma}}{4\pi M_\chi^2}
\int_{line\;of\;sight}\rho_{\chi}^2(l)\; d\,l(\psi)\;,
\label{eq:gaflux}
\eeq
where $\psi$ is an angle to label the direction of observation and where 
$N_{\gamma} = 2$ for $\chi\,\chi\rightarrow \gamma\,\gamma$, 
$N_{\gamma} = 1$ for $\chi\,\chi\rightarrow Z\,\gamma$. Analogously,
the gamma-ray flux with continuum energy spectrum is obtained by replacing
$N_{\gamma}\;v\sigma_{X^0\gamma}$ with 
$\sum_f dN_{\gamma}^f/dE\;v\sigma_{f}$, where the sum is over all tree
level final states. Separating the dependence on the dark matter distribution
from the part which is related to values of the cross section and the 
neutralino mass, we rewrite Eq.~(\ref{eq:gaflux}) as:
\beq
{d\Phi_{\gamma}(\psi)\over d\Omega} 
\simeq  1.87 \cdot 10^{-11}\left( \frac{N_{\gamma}\;v\sigma_{X^0\gamma}}
{10^{-29}\ {\rm cm}^3 {\rm s}^{-1}}\right)\left( \frac{10\,\rm{GeV}}
{M_\chi}\right)^2 \cdot 
J\left(\psi\right)\;\rm{cm}^{-2}\;\rm{s}^{-1}\;\rm{sr}^{-1}\;,
\eeq
where we have defined the dimensionless function
\beq
J\left(\psi\right) = \frac{1} {8.5\, \rm{kpc}}
\cdot \left(\frac{1}{0.3\,{\rm GeV}/{\rm cm}^3}\right)^2
\int_{line\;of\;sight}\rho_{\chi}^2(l)\; d\,l(\psi)\;.
\label{eq:jpsi}
\eeq
The relevant quantity for a measurement is, rather than $J\left(\psi\right)$,
the integral of $J\left(\psi\right)$ over the solid angle given by the
angular acceptance $\Delta\Omega$ of a detector which is pointing in
the direction $\psi$. Defining:
\begin{equation}
\langle\,J\left(\psi\right)\rangle_{\Delta\Omega}
= \frac{1}{\Delta\Omega} \int_{\Delta\Omega} d\Omega^{\prime}
J\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)\;, 
\label{eq:jave}
\end{equation}
the flux measured in a detector is:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\gamma}(\psi, \Delta\Omega) = 1.87 \cdot 10^{-11}
\left(\frac{N_{\gamma}\;v\sigma_{X^0\gamma}}
{10^{-29}\ {\rm cm}^3 {\rm s}^{-1}}\right)
\left( \frac{10\,\rm{GeV}}{M_\chi}\right)^2 
\langle\,J\left(\psi\right)\rangle_{\Delta\Omega}\times\Delta\Omega 
\;\rm{cm}^{-2}\;\rm{s}^{-1}\; \rm{sr}^{-1}\; .
\label{signal}
\end{equation}
Finally, the formalism we introduced can be used also to estimate
the flux in the simple case of a single source which, for the given 
detector, can be approximated as point-like (see examples below). 
If such 
source is in the direction $\psi$ at a distance $d$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:jave})
becomes:
\begin{equation}
\langle\,J\left(\psi\right)\rangle_{\Delta\Omega}
= \frac{1} {8.5\, \rm{kpc}}
\cdot \left(\frac{1}{0.3\,{\rm GeV}/{\rm cm}^3}\right)^2
\cdot \frac{1}{d^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\Delta\Omega}
\int d^3r \;\rho_{\chi}^2(\vec{r}) 
\end{equation}
where the integral is over the extention of the source (much smaller
than $d$).

Several targets have been discussed as sources of gamma-rays from the
annihilation of dark matter particles. An obvious source is the dark
halo of our own galaxy~\cite{galga} and in particular the Galactic center,
as the dark matter density profile is expected, in most models, to be 
picked towards it, possibly with huge enhancements close to te central 
black hole. The Galactic center is an ideal target for both ground-
and space-based gamma-ray telescopes. As satellite experiments have 
much wider field of views and will provide a full sky coverage,
they will test the hypothesis of gamma-rays emitted in clumps of dark 
matter which may be present in the 
halo~\cite{clumpyga,gahalo,clumpy,clumpybeg}. 
Another possibility which has been considered is the case of 
gamma-ray fluxes from external nearby galaxies~\cite{extergal}. 
Furthermore, it has 
been proposed to search for an extragalactic flux originated by all 
cosmological annihilations of dark matter 
particles~\cite{extragal,extragalbeu}.

\ds\ is suitable to compute the gamma-ray flux from all these (and possibly 
other) sources. Two cases are fully included in the package:
assuming neutralinos are smoothly distributed in the Galactic halo
with $\rho_{\chi}$ equal to the dark matter density profile, in 
\ds\ Eq.~\ref{eq:jave} is computed for a specified halo profile and 
any given $\psi$ and $\Delta\Omega$~\cite{lpj}. 
The second option deals with the
case of a portion of dark matter being in the form of clumps, each of
which is treated as a non-resolvable source in the detector, distributed
in the Galaxy according to a probability distribution which
follows the dark matter density profile (see \cite{clumpy}
for details). It is straightforward to extend this to all other 
astrophysical sources; in case of cosmological sources one has just 
to pay attention to include redshift effects and absoption on starlight 
and infrared background, see~\cite{extragalbeu}.

\section{Neutrinos from halo -- theory}

Usually, the flux of neutrinos from annihilation of neutralinos in
the Milky Way halo is too small to be detectable, but for some clumpy
or cuspy models, it might be detectable. The calculation of the
neutrino-flux follows closely the calculation of the continuous gamma
ray flux, with the main addition that neutrino interactions close to
the detector are also included. Hence, both the neutrino flux and the
neutrino-induced muon flux can be obtained. The neutrino to muon
conversion rate in the Earth can also be obtained.

\section{Initialization routines}

Before \ds\ is used for some calculations, it needs to be
initialized. This is done with a call to \codeb{dsinit}. This routine
makes sure that all standard parameters are defined, such as standard
model parameters and particle codes. It also calls the different
\codeb{ds*set} routines with the argument \code{default}. E.g., the
halo model is set to the default choice with a call to
\codeb{dshmset}\code{('default')}. Analogously, all other routines
with a \codeb{ds*set} routine is also called to set them up to the
default model/parameters.

This means that the call to \codeb{dsinit} should be the first call in
any program using \ds. Any calls the user makes to other routines,
either to calculte things or select a different model (e.g.\ a
different halo model) should come after the call to \codeb{dsinit}.

\section{Muon yields from annihilation in the Earth/Sun -- theory}

We need to take into account all processes that yield muon neutrinos from
annihilation in the Earth/Sun.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Monte Carlo simulations}
\label{sec:nt-mcsim}

We need to
evaluate the yield of different particles per neutralino annihilation.
The hadronization and/or decay of the annihilation products are
simulated with {\sc Pythia} \cite{pythia} 6.154
and we here describe how the simulations are done.
For annihilation in the Sun/Earth 
the simulations are done for a set of 18 neutralino
masses, $m_{\chi}$ = 10, 25, 50, 80.3, 91.2, 100, 150, 176, 200, 250,
350, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 5000 GeV\@. We tabulate the
yields and then interpolate these tables in \ds.

We are mainly interested in the flux of high energy muon neutrinos
     and neutrino-induced muons at a neutrino telescope.  We simulate 6
     `fundamental' annihilation channels, $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$,
     $t\bar{t}$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $W^+W^-$ and $Z^0 Z^{0}$ for each mass
     (where kinematically allowed) above. The lighter leptons and
     quarks don't contribute significantly and can safely be
     neglected. \comment{Include $gg$?}  Pions and kaons get stopped
     before they decay and are thus made stable in the {\sc Pythia}
     simulations so that they don't produce any neutrinos.  For
     annihilation channels containing Higgs bosons, we can calculate
     the yield from these fundamental channels by letting the Higgs
     bosons decaying in flight (see below).  We also take into account
     the energy losses of $B$-mesons in the Sun and the Earth by
     following the approximate treatment of \cite{RS} but with updated
     $B$-meson interaction cross sections as given in
     \cite{joakimthesis}.  We also take neutrino-interactions on the
     way out of the Sun into account by considering the charged-current
     interaction as a neutrino-loss and the neutral current
     interactions are simulated with {\sc Pythia}.  The
     neutrino-nucleon charged current interactions close to the
     detector are also simulated with {\sc Pythia} and finally the
     multiple Coulomb scattering of the muon on its way to the detector
     is calculated using distributions from~\cite{PDG}. We have used the ???
     structure functions in these simulations.
     For more details on these simulations, see~\cite{Edpre,Angdist}.

     \comment{Structure functions?}

     For each annihilation channel and mass we simulate $1.25 \times
     10^{6}$ annihilations and tabulate the final results as a
     neutrino-yield, neutrino-to-muon conversion rate and a muon yield
     differential in energy and angle from the center of the Sun/Earth.
     We also tabulate the integrated yield above a given threshold and
     below an open-angle $\theta$. We assumed throughout that the
     surrounding medium is water with a density of 1.0 g/cm$^3$. Hence,
     the neutrino-to-muon conversion rates have to be multiplied by the
     density of the medium. In the muon fluxes, the density cancels out
     (to within a few percent).
     \comment{Neutrino-nucleon cross sections?}
     \comment{Simulate for rock?}


With these simulations, we can calculate the yield for any of these
particles for a given MSSM model.  For the Higgs bosons, which decay
in flight, an integration over the angle of the decay products with
respect to the direction of the Higgs boson is performed.  Given the
branching ratios for different annihilation channels it is then
straightforward to compute the muon flux above any given energy
threshold and within any angular region around the Sun or the center
of the Earth.

\label{ch:src-nt}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Neutrinos from the Sun and Earth --  theory}

There are several indirect methods for detection of neutralinos.
One of the most promising \cite{neutrinos} is to make use of the
fact that scattering of halo neutralinos by the Sun and the planets,
in particular the Earth, during the several
billion years that the Solar system has existed, will have trapped
these neutralinos within these astrophysical bodies. Being trapped
within the Solar or terrestrial material, they will sink towards
the center, where a considerable enrichment and corresponding
increase of annihilation rate will occur.


Searches for neutralino annihilation into neutrinos
will be subject to  extensive experimental investigations in view
of the new neutrino telescopes (AMANDA, IceCube, Baikal, NESTOR, ANTARES)
planned or under construction \cite{halzen}. A high-energy
neutrino signal in the direction of the centre of the Sun or Earth
is an excellent experimental signature which may stand up against
the background of neutrinos generated by cosmic-ray interactions in the
Earth's atmosphere.

There are several different approximations one could do, or processes to
include when calculating the capture rates in the Earth/Sun and many of these
are coded into \ds. The default in \ds\ is always to use the best calculations
available, but more approximate (older) routines are also available,
as well as more speculative signals, like the Damour-Krauss signal
(not included by default). If you want to use something else than the
defaults, or want to call more internal rotuines (more internal than
\code{dsntrates} or \code{dsntdiffrates}), you should read the
following sections carefully.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Neutrino yield from annihilations}

The differential neutrino flux from neutralino annihilation is
\beq
\frac{dN_\nu}{dE_\nu} =
\frac{\Gamma_A}{4\pi D^2} \sum_{f}
B^{f}_{\chi}\frac{dN^f_\nu}{dE_\nu}
\eeq
where $\Gamma_A$ is the annihilation rate,
$D$ is the distance of the detector from the source (the
central region of the Earth or the Sun), $f$ is the neutralino pair
annihilation final states,
and $B^{f}_{\chi}$ are the branching ratios into the final state $f$.
  $dN^f_\nu/dE_{\nu}$ are the energy
distributions of  neutrinos generated by the final state $f$ and are
obtained from the {\sc Pythia} simulations described in section
\ref{sec:mcsim}.

In comparison with calculations using the results of \cite{RS}
(e.g.\ ~\cite{neuprod}), this
Monte Carlo treatment of the neutrino propagation through the Sun
does not need the simplifying assumptions previously made, namely neutral
currents are no more assumed to be much weaker than charged currents
and energy loss is no more considered continuous.

The neutrino-induced muon flux may be detected in a neutrino telescope
by measuring the muons that come from the direction of the centre
of the Sun or Earth. For a shallow detector, this usually has to
be done in the case of the Sun by looking (as always the case for
the Earth) at upward-going muons, since there is a huge background
of downward-going muons created by cosmic-ray interactions in the
atmosphere. There is always in addition a more isotropic
background coming from muon neutrinos created on the other side of
the Earth in such cosmic-ray events (and also from cosmic-ray
interactions in the outer regions of the Sun).
The flux of muons at the detector is  given by

\beq
\frac{d N_\mu}{d E_\mu}
= N_A \int^\infty_{E_\mu^{\rm th}} d E_\nu
\int_0^\infty d\lambda \int_{E_\mu}^{E_\nu}
d {E'_\mu }\,\,
P(E_\mu,E'_\mu; \lambda)\,\,
\frac{d \sigma_\nu (E_\nu,E'_\mu)}{d E'_\mu} \,\,
\frac{d N_\nu}{d E_\nu}\, ,
\label{eq:muflux}
\eeq
where $\lambda$ is the muon range in the medium (ice or water
for the large detectors in the ocean or at the South Pole,
or rock which surrounds the smaller underground detectors),
$d \sigma_\nu (E_\nu,E'_\mu) / d E'_\mu$ is
the weak interaction cross section for production of a muon of
energy $E'_\mu$ from a parent neutrino of energy $E_\nu$, and
$P(E_\mu,E'_\mu; \lambda)$ is the
probability for a muon of initial energy $E'_\mu$
to have a final energy $E_\mu$ after passing
  a path--length $\lambda$ inside the detector medium.
$E_\mu^{\rm th}$ is the detector threshold energy, which for
``small''
neutrino telescopes like Baksan, MACRO and Super-Kamiokande is
around 1 GeV.
Large area neutrino telescopes in the ocean  or in Antarctic ice
typically
have thresholds of the order of tens of GeV, which makes them
sensitive mainly to heavy neutralinos (above 100 GeV)
\cite{begnu2}.

The integrand in Eq.~(\ref{eq:muflux}) is weighted towards high
neutrino energies, both because the cross section $\sigma_\nu$
rises approximately linearly with energy and because the average
muon energy, and therefore the range $\lambda$, also grow
approximately linearly with $E_\nu$. Therefore, final states
which give a hard neutrino spectrum (such as heavy quarks, $\tau$
leptons and $W$ or $Z$ bosons) are usually more important
than the soft spectrum arising from light quarks and gluons.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evolution of the number density in the Earth/Sun}

Neutralinos are steadily being trapped in the Sun or Earth by
scattering, whereas annihilations take them away.
Let $N(t)$ be the total number of neutralinos trapped, at time $t$, in the core
of, for example,  the Earth.
The annihilation rate of neutralino pairs can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_a (t) = \frac{1}{2} \ C_a \, N^2 (t) \, . \label{eqx.1}
\end{equation}

The evolution of $N(t)$ is the result of the competition between capture and
annihilation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt} = C_c (t) - C_a \, N^2 \label{eqx.2}
\end{equation}
The constant $C_c$ is the capture rate, and
$C_a$ entering equations (\ref{eqx.1}) and (\ref{eqx.2}) is linked to
the annihilation cross-section $\sigma_a$, and to some effective volumes $V_j$,
$j=1,2$, taking into account the quasi-thermal distribution of neutralinos in
the Earth core:
\begin{equation}
C_a = \langle \sigma_a \, v \rangle \, \frac{V_2 }{ V_1^2} \, , \label{eq6.3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_j \simeq 2.3 \times 10^{25} \, \left(\frac{j \, m_X}{ 10 \, {\rm 
GeV}}\right)^{-3/2} \, {\rm
cm}^3 \, . \label{eq6.4}
\end{equation}

This has the solution for the annihilation rate implemented in \ds\
\beq
\Gamma_A={C_c\over 2} \tanh^2\left({t\over \tau}\right),\label{eq:tanh}
\eeq
where the equilibration time scale $\tau=1/\sqrt{C_cC_a}$.  In most
cases for the Sun, and in the cases of observable fluxes for the
Earth, $\tau$ is much smaller than a few billion years, and therefore
equilibrium is often a good approximation ($\dot N(t)=0$).
This means
that it is the capture rate which is the important quantity that
determines the neutrino flux. However, in the program we keep the exact
formula (\ref{eq:tanh}), with some
modifications discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:dk}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Approximate capture rate expressions}

The capture rate induced by scalar (spin-independent) interactions
between the neutralinos and the nuclei in the interior of the Earth or
Sun is the most difficult one to compute, since it depends sensitively
on the Higgs mass, form factors, and other poorly known quantities.
However, this spin-independent capture rate calculation is the same as
for direct detection treated in Section~\ref{subs:direct}.  Therefore,
there is a strong correlation between the neutrino flux expected from
the Earth (which is mainly composed of spin-less nuclei) and the
signal predicted in direct detection experiments \cite{begnu2,kamsad}.
It seems that even the large (kilometer-scale) neutrino telescopes
planned, when searching for neutralino annihilation in the Earth, will
not be competitive with the next generation of direct detection
experiments when it comes to detecting neutralino dark matter.
However, the situation concerning the Sun is more favourable.  Due to
the low counting rates for the spin-dependent interactions in
terrestrial detectors, high-energy neutrinos from the Sun constitute a
competitive and complementary neutralino dark matter search.  Of
course, even if a neutralino is found through direct detection, it
will be extremely important to confirm its identity and investigate
its properties through indirect detection.  In particular, the mass
can be determined with reasonable accuracy by looking at the angular
distribution of the detected muons \cite{EG,BEK}.

For the Sun, dominated by hydrogen, the axial (spin-dependent)
cross section is important and relatively easy to compute.  A
reasonably good
approximation is given by \cite{jkg}
\beq
      {C^{\rm sd}_\odot\over (1.3\cdot 10^{23}\, {\rm s}^{-1})
\left(270\ {\rm km\,s^{-1}}/ \bar v\right)}=
\left({\rho_\chi\over 0.3\ {\rm GeV}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}}\right)
      \left({100\,{\rm GeV}\over m_\chi}\right)
\left({\sigma_{p\chi}^{\rm sd}\over 10^{-40}\ {\rm
      cm}^2}\right)
\eeq
where $\sigma_{p\chi}^{\rm sd}$ is the cross section for
neutralino-proton elastic scattering via the axial-vector interaction,
$\bar v$ is the dark-matter velocity dispersion, and $\rho_\chi$ is
the local dark matter mass.  The capture rate in the Earth is
dominated by scalar interactions, where there may be kinematic and
other enhancements, in particular if the mass of the neutralino almost
matches one of the heavy elements in the Earth.  For this case, a more
detailed analysis is called for, which is available in \cite{Gould87}
with convenient approximations in \cite{jkg}.
   In fact, also for the
Sun the spin-independent contribution can be important, in particular
iron may contribute non-negligibly.
For the Sun, the
  approximation in \cite{jkg} is also available,
\beqa

where $f_A$ is the mass fraction of element $A$ and $\phi_A$ is the
typical gravitational potential (relative to the surface) for that
element. I.e.\ an element that is concentrated in the core will have a
higher $\phi_A$ than an element at the surface. $A$ is the atomic
number of the element and $M_{A}$ is its mass. The factor $S$ is a
kinematical suppression factor \cite{jkg,kamion91}. In the next
subsection we will go through the compositions of the Earth/Sun that
we use.

The approximate capture rate expressions above are coded into the routines
\code{dsntcapsun} and \code{dsntcapearth}. More accurate expressions
will follow in the coming subsections.

\subsection{Earth and Sun composition}

When the capture rates are calculated, we need to know the composition
and density of the Earth/Sun as a function of depth.  

In \cite{jkg} they used average mass fractions and potentials for the
location of the various elements in the Sun. We have updated these to
the BP2000 \cite{bp2000} values instead, as given in Table~\ref{tab:suncomp}

\begin{table}

\end{table}

For the Earth, we have also implemented more accurate
density profiles and more up-to date chemical distributions within the
Earth. We use the estimates for the Earth composition given in
\cite{earthcomp}[Table 2 for the mantle and Table 4 for the core]. In
Table~\ref{tab:earthcomp} we list these values together with the
average parameters $f_i$ and $\phi_i$ that should be used in the
expressions for the approximate capture rates in the previous
section. Note that using these average parameters instead of
integrating over the full radius is equivalent to putting all the
elements of the give type at the gravitational potential $\phi_i$.

\caption{In a) the density profile and in b) the escape velocity in the Earth is shown.}
\label{fig:eadensvesc}
\end{figure}

We also need the density profile of the Earth, and for this we use the
values in \cite{EncBrit}. Using this density profile, we can calculate
the gravitational potential, $\phi(r)$ inside the Earth and from this
one the escape velocity $v$ inside the Earth,
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:vesc}
   v = 11.2 \sqrt{\frac{\phi(r)}{\phi(R_\oplus)}} \mbox{~km/s.}
\end{equation}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:eadensvesc} we show the density profile and escape
velocity inside the Earth. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{More accurate capture rate expressions}

Another complicating factor when calculating the capture rates is the
integration over the velocity 
distribution. In \cite{Gould87}, parts of the integrations are
performed analytically for a Gaussian veolocity distributions. These
expressions are also coded in \ds for the Earth and give a more
accurate calculation of the capture rate in the Earth than the
approximations given above. The routine \code{dsntcapearth2} performs
these calculations for the Earth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Accurate capture rates in the Earth for general velocity distributions}


If one wants even more accurate and general expressions for the
capture rates in the Sun/Earth, we have also implemented the full
expressions in \cite{Gould87}, but without assuming that the velocity
distribution is a Gaussian (or Maxwell-Boltzmann). These routines are
now the default in \ds.

We will here outline how these expressions look
like for the Earth and how they can be used both for a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution and for a general velocity distribution. The expressions
will of course look analogously for the Sun. We start with
the general case and study the special case of a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution in the next section. 

We will divide the Earth into shells and calculate the capture from
element $i$ in each shell individually. At the end we will integrate
over all the shells and sum over all the elements in the Earth. The
capture rate from element $i$ per unit shell volume is given by
\cite{Gould87}[Eq.~(2.8)] 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dcdv}
    \frac{dC_i}{dV} = \int_0^{u_{max}} du \frac{f(u)}{u} w \Omega_{v,i}^-(w)
\end{equation}
where $f(u)$ is the velocity distribution (normalized such that
$\int_0^\infty\ f(u) = n_\chi$ where $n_\chi$ is the number density of
WIMPs. The expression $\Omega_{v,i}^-(w)$ is related to the
probability that we scatter to orbits below the escape velocity. $w$
is the velocity at the given shell and it is related to the velocity
at infinity $u$ and the escape velocity $v$ by 
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   w = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}.
\end{equation}
The upper limit of integration is a priori set to $u_{max} = \infty$,
but we will see below that due to kinematical reasons we can set it to
a lower value (Eq.~(\ref{eq:umax}) below). 
If we allow for a form factor suppression of the form \cite{Gould87}[Eq.~(A3)]
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   |F(q^2)|^2 = \exp\left( - \frac{\Delta E}{E_0} \right)
\end{equation}
with \cite{Gould87}[Eq.~(A4)]
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   E_0 = \frac{3 \hbar^2}{2m_\chi R^2}
\end{equation}
we can evaluate $w \Omega_{v,i}^-(w)$ and arrive at the expression
\cite{Gould87}[Eq.~(A6)] 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:womega}
   w \Omega_{v,i}^- (w) = \sigma_i n_i \frac{\mu_+^2}{\mu}2 E_0 \left[
   e^{- \frac{m_\chi u^2}{2E_0}} - e^{-\frac{\mu}{\mu_+^2}m_\chi \frac{u^2+v^2}{2E_0}}
   \right] \Theta\left( \frac{\mu}{\mu_+^2} - \frac{u^2}{u^2+v^2} \right)
\end{equation}
where we have introduced
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   \mu = \frac{m_\chi}{m_i} \quad ; \quad \mu_\pm = \frac{\mu \pm 1}{2}
\end{equation}
with $m_i$ the mass of element $i$. The Heaviside step function
$\Theta$ plays the role of only including WIMPs that can scatter to a
velocity lower then the escape velocity $v$. To simplify our
calculations we can drop this step function in Eq.~(\ref{eq:womega})
and instead set the upper limit of integration in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dcdv})
to 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:umax}
  u_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\mu_-^2}} v
\end{equation}
We also need the scattering cross section on element $i$, which can be
written as 
\cite{jkg}[Eq.~(9-25)]
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigma_i}
   \sigma_i = \sigma_p A_i^2 \frac{(m_\chi m_i)^2}{(m_\chi+m_i)^2} 
   \frac{(m_\chi + m_p)^2}{(m_\chi m_p)^2}
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ is the atomic number of the element, $m_p$ is the proton
mass and $\sigma_p$ is the scattering cross section on protons. 

We now have what we need to calculate the capture rate. In
Eq.~(\ref{eq:dcdv}) we integrate over the velocity for our chosen
velocity distribution. We then integrate this equation over the radius
of the Earth and sum over all the different elements in the Earth, 
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   C = \int_0^{R_\oplus} dr \sum_i \frac{dC_i}{dV} 4 \pi r^2
\end{equation}
Note that we have not assumed anything special about our velocity
distribution, it doesn't even have to be isotropic since the
distribution of elements evenly in the shells will make an anisotropic
distribution on average to behave as an isotropic one. 

The routines that calculate the capture rates with these general (and
accurate) expressions are \code{dsntcapearthnum} and
\code{dsntcapsunnum}. As these calculations are somewhat
time-consuming, we have also added a possibility to tabulate the
result and interpolate in these tables. To use (or create, if the
table files are missing) instead call \code{dsntcapearthtab} and
\code{dsntcapsuntab}. These last two routines are the default in
\ds. The velocity distribution used is determined by a switch when the
halo model is set (i.e.\ when \code{dshmset} is called).


%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Accurate capture rates for the Earth for a
  Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution}

We will here give some more information on how the approximations
introduced in the beginning of this chapter are derived from the
general expressions in the preceeding section.

If the velocity distribution is of Maxwell-Boltzmann type we can
greatly simplify our expressions above as we can perform the
integration over velocity analytically. The integration over radius
can also be further simplified by using the average mass fractions
$f_i$ and potentials $\phi_i$ in Tables~\ref{tab:suncomp}--\ref{tab:earthcomp}. 

If the velocity distribution in the halo is Maxwell-Boltzmann, it looks like
\begin{equation}
\label{ }
   f_h(u) du = n_\chi \frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}} \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
   \frac{u^2}{\bar{v}^3}
   e^{-\frac{3}{2}\frac{u^2}{\bar{v}^2}} du
\end{equation}
where $\bar{v}$ is the three-dimensional velocity dispersion and
$n_\chi$ is the number density of WIMPs in the halo. However, the
solar system moves through the halo with a velocity $v_*$ and the
distribution on observer with this velocity through the halo will see
is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fstaru}
  f_*(u) = f_h(u) e^{-\frac{3}{2}\frac{v_*^2}{\bar{v}^2}} 
  \frac{\sinh\left(\frac{3 u v_*}{\bar{v}^2}\right)}{\frac{3 u v_*}{\bar{v}^2}} =
  n_\chi \sqrt{\frac{3}{2\pi}} \frac{u}{\bar{v} v_*} \left[
  e^{-\frac{3}{2} \frac{( u-v_*)^2}{\bar{v}^2}} -
  e^{-\frac{3}{2} \frac{( u+v_*)^2}{\bar{v}^2}} \right]
\end{equation}
Now one would naively believe that this is not the distribution that
an observer at the Earth will see. First of all, the Earth is moving
with respect to the Sun and secondly, the WIMPs have gained speed by
the gravitational attraction of the Sun when they reach the
Earth. Both of these arguments are true and the distribution of WIMPs
in the halo will not look like Eq.~(\ref{eq:fstaru}) to an observer on
the Earth. However, Gould \cite{Gould91} showed that WIMPs from the
halo can diffuse into the solar system due to gravitational
interactions with the planets and this distribution of WIMPs will
roughly look like as if the Earth was in free space moving through the
halo with the velocity of the solar system,
i.e.\ Eq.~(\ref{eq:fstaru}). We will later scrutinize this statement,
as it turns out that it does not quite hold, but 
as a first guess it is a reasonable approximation. For the Sun,
though, the velocity distribution give above is the correct one for a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

With the distribution Eq.~(\ref{eq:fstaru}) we can analytically
perform the integration over velocity in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dcdv}). After
some algebra we arrive at \cite{Gould87}[Eq.~(A10)] 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dC_i}{dV} & = & \left( \frac{8}{3\pi} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} 
\frac{\sigma_i n_i n_\chi \bar{v}}{2b\eta} \nonumber \\
 & & \Bigg[ \frac{e^{-a\hat{\eta}^2}}{\sqrt{1+a}} \left[ 2 \widetilde{\rm erf}(\hat{\eta}) - \widetilde{\rm erf} (\hat{A}_+) + \widetilde{\rm erf} (\hat{A}_-) \right]
   \nonumber \\ 
& &  - \frac{e^{-b\check{\eta}^2}}{\sqrt{1+b}}
   e^{-(a-b)A^2} \left[ 2 \widetilde{\rm erf}(\check{\eta}) - \widetilde{\rm erf} (\check{A}_+) + \widetilde{\rm erf} (\check{A}_-)
   \right] \Bigg]
   \label{eq:dcdvmb}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\widetilde{\rm erf}$ is the modified error function,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moderf}
   \widetilde{\rm erf} (x) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} {\rm erf} (x)
   \qquad ; \qquad {\rm erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-y^2} dy.
\end{equation}
Following Gould \cite{Gould87}, we have in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dcdvmb})
introduced the following shorthand notation: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\eta = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{v_*^2}{\bar{v}^2} & ; &
a = \frac{m_chi \bar{v}^2}{3E_0} & ; & b=\frac{\mu}{\mu_+^2} a \\
\hat{\eta} = \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{1+a}} & ; & \check{\eta} = \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{1+b}} \\
A^2 = \frac{3}{2} \frac{v^2}{\bar{v}^2} \frac{\mu}{\mu_-^2} & ; &
\hat{A} = A \sqrt{1+a} & ; & \check{A} = A \sqrt{1+b} \\
\hat{A}_\pm = \hat{A} \pm \hat{\eta} & ; & \check{A}_\pm = \check{A} \pm \check{\eta}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
If we wish, we can now integrate Eq.~(\ref{eq:dcdvmb}) over radius
just like in the previous section, but we can without loosing too much
accuracy, replace this integration with a sum over the elements in the
Earth with their respective typical location. I.e.\ we can write 
\begin{equation}
\label{ctotmb}
  C = \sum_i \frac{dC_i}{dV}\frac{1}{n_i} \frac{f_i M_\oplus}{m_i}  
\end{equation}
where we instead of the number density $n_i$ use the total number of
atoms of the given type $f_i M_\oplus/m_i$. Note that for each element
in the sum we should evaluate this expression at the given typical
gravitational potential $\phi_i$ of the element, i.e.\ with the escape
velocity given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:vesc}). The mass fractions $f_i$ and
typical potentials $\phi_i$ are listed in Table
\ref{tab:earthcomp} (and analogously in Table~\ref{tab:suncomp} for
the Sun). This approximation introduces an error of no more
than about 1--2\% for a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution\footnote{Note
  that it is not advisable to use this approximation for general
  velocity distributions. If one e.g.\ has a lower limit on possible
  velocities, $u_{min}$, for heavy WIMPs capture will then only be
  possible very close to the central core. Replacing the actual
  distribution of potentials $\phi(r)$ with the typical value $\phi_i$
  may then introduce larger errors. We will encounter these kind of
  distributions shortly.} 

The capture rate evaluated with the expressions shown here are encoded
into the routine \code{dsntcapearth2}. Note that we have not coded the
corresponding approximate expressions for the Sun. Instead, as given
in the preceeding section, we now have more accurate expressions for
both the Sun and the Earth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A possible new population of neutralinos}\label{sec:dk}

Recently, it has been shown that the scattering process in the Sun can
populate orbits which subsequently result in a bound Solar System
population of WIMPs~\cite{dk1,dk2} and which can be comparable in
spectral density, in the region of the Earth, to the Galactic halo
WIMP population.  This new population consists of WIMPs that have
scattered in the outer layers of the Sun and due to perturbations by
the other planets (mainly Venus and Jupiter) evolve into bound orbits
which do not cross the Sun but do cross the Earth's orbit.  This
population of WIMPs should have a completely different velocity
distribution than halo WIMPs and will thus have quite different
capture probabilities in the Earth.  The predicted WIMP abundance, and
spectrum, relevant for direct detection have been calculated in
\cite{dk1,dk2}, where it was shown that although the total rates may
not change by a large amount, there could be a striking directional
effect, which could be of impoertance once detectors with directional
sensitivity are built.  Also for capture in the Earth, and the
predicted indirect neutrino signature, there are poissibly large
effects, incorporated as an optional choice in \ds, coming from this
new population \cite{dkpop}.  (Other studies of solar system
populations of WIMPs can be found in \cite{otherpop,Gould91}.  See
also the comments in \cite{gouldnew} about the uncertainties involved
in estimating these effects.)

The enhancement caused by the new population is only important for
neutralino mass less than 150 - 170 GeV (the exact number depending on
details about the angular momentum distribution \cite{dkpop}).

Following the notation of~\cite{dk1,dk2} one can write the
contribution from the new population of neutralinos to the usual halo
neutralino density as
\begin{equation}
   \delta_E \equiv \frac{n (a_1)}{n_X} \equiv \frac{\hbox{(secondary) neutralino
   density at the Earth}}{\hbox{halo neutralino density at infinity}} \, ,
   \label{eq5.11}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
   \delta_E = \frac{5.44 \times 10^{36}}{(v_o / 220 \, {\rm km\,s}^{-1})}
   \times
   g_{\rm tot} \, {\rm GeV} \, {\rm cm}^{-2} = \frac{0.212}{(v_o / 220 \,
   {\rm km\,s}^{-1})} \, g_{\rm tot}^{(-10)} \, . \label{eq5.15}
\end{equation}
Here, $g_{\rm tot}^{(-10)} \equiv 10^{10} \, g_{\rm tot} ({\rm
GeV})^3$, and $g_{\rm tot} = { \sum_A} \, (f_A / m_A) \, \sigma_A \,
\phi_A^s$, where $f_A$ is the mass fraction of element $A$ in the Sun,
and $\phi_A^s$ is the surface value of the capture function on the
element of mass number $A$ in the Sun \cite{dk2}.

The scattering rate of neutralinos in the outer layers of the Sun (which
causes the fast halo neutralinos to lose enough energy to enter bound orbits
close to the Earth's orbit) is proportional to $\sigma_A \phi_A^s$, which
can be calculated once the parameters of the SUSY neutralino in question are
fixed. (For the elemental abundances in the Sun, we use the compilation
in~\cite{jnb}.)

The values of $g_{\rm tot}^{(-10)}$
can in some cases approach unity. The spread is
very large, however, and some models give orders of magnitude smaller
values. As would be expected, the models with the highest values of
$g_{\rm tot}^{(-10)}$ are the same models which give high scattering
rates in direct detection experiments.
As mentioned, the integrated effect of the
new population in direct experiments is not very prominent
(see refs.~\cite{dk1,dk2}). On
the other hand,  they can imply a large effect
on indirect detection neutrino rates.

The total capture rate  is computed according
to the formulas in \cite{dkpop}, which take into account that the annihilation
rates from the earth will, in general depend on time in a different
way than the simple result in Eq.~(\ref{eq:tanh}).

Due to this nonlinear nature of the capture rate, there is no simple
scaling of the computed detection rates with the local halo density.
Therefore, it is advisable that the user rescales the local halo
density (see section \ref{sec:rescale}) before calculating the rates
in neutrino telescopes.

The new population can cause an increase of the detection rates
by as much as a factor of 100 when the neutralino mass is less
than around 150 GeV\@.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Effects of WIMP diffusion in the solar system}

As the Earth has a rather low escape velocity, the Earth will only be
able to capture WIMPs that have a rather low velocity with respect to
the Earth. However, WIMPs from the halo have gained speed in the
gravitaional potential from the Sun and will essentially be impossible
to capture by the Earth. Hence, the Earth will only capture WIMPs that
have diffused around in the solar system (by gravitational
interactions with the other planets). Gould showed \cite{gould-diff}
that effectively this diffusion will lead to the same phase space
distribution at the Earth as if the Earth was in free space
(i.e.\ neglecting the solar potential). However, numerical simulations
of asteroids showed that they are thrown into the Sun due to
perturbations of the orbits by other planets, see
e.g.\ \cite{farinella}. These analyses led to worried that maybe the
population of WIMPs diffusing around in the solar system is not as big
as thought \cite{gould-conserv}. In \cite{earth-diff}, Lundberg and
Edsj\"o investigated this issue with detailed numerical simulations of
WIMP orbits in the solar system, showing that the annihilation rate in
the Earth is typically reduced by up to two orders of magnitude. In
\ds, we include these results for the neutrino rates from the Earth by
using the velocity distribution at the Earth (as obtained in
\cite{earth-diff}). This velocity distribution is then used as input
for our numerical capture rate routines instead of the usual
approximation of using the halo velocity distribution directly. Using
these new velocity distributions for the Earth is the default in \ds.

\section{Neutrinos from Sun and Earth --  routines}

\comment{NOTE: This section is not up-to date with the current
  \ds\ release.}

This set of routines contain routines to calculate the
neutrino-induced muon flux from the Earth and the Sun in various
models. It also includes routines that calculate the neutrino-induced
muon flux from other sources, like the Sun's atmosphere, the Earth's
atmosphere \mcomment{(include these???)}.

There are three different methods of calculation available (determined
by \texttt{ntcalcmet} in \texttt{dsntcom.h}). Method 1 uses the
approximate formulae for the capture rates in the Earth/Sun from the
Jungman, Kamionkowski and Griest review \cite{jkg}. Method 2, uses the
same expression for the Sun, but the full expression from Gould
\cite{Gould321} for capture in the Earth (this is the default). Method
3, finally, is the same as 2, but it also includes capture in the
Earth from the Damour-Krauss population of WIMPs that have scattered
in the outscirts of the Sun. The easiest way to select method is by
calling \texttt{dsntset}, with the argument 'jkg' for method 1, 'gould'
or 'default' for method 2 and 'dk' for method 3. A call to 
\texttt{dsntset('default')} is made in \texttt{dsinit}, but can be
changed by the user by calling \texttt{dsntset} after \texttt{dsinit}.

To calculate the neutrino-induced muon flux from the Earth, you call

\begin{sub}{subroutine
\ftb{dsntrates}(emuth,thmax,rtype,rateea,ratesu,istat)}
  \itit{Purpose:} Calculate the rate of neutrinos or neutrino-induced
  muons in a neutrino telescope from neutralino annihilation in the

  towards the center of the Sun or the Earth, where the top-angle of
  the cone is 2*\ft{thmax}).

c                             it is presumed that the requested

c                             adjustments into account). however, if
c                             this yields no improvement it is advised

c                             will probably gain from splitting up the
c                             interval at this point and calling the
c                             integrator on the subranges. if possible,
c                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
c                             should be used, which is designed for

c                             tolerance from being achieved.
c                             the error may be under-estimated.
c                         = 3 extremely bad integrand behaviour
c                             occurs at some points of the integration

c                             it is presumed that the requested
c                             tolerance cannot be achieved, and that the
c                             returned result is the best which can be

\chapter[pb: Antiproton fluxes from the halo]{\codeb{src/pb}:\\ Antiproton fluxes from the halo}
\label{ch:src-pb}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Antiprotons -- theory}

Neutralinos can annihilate each other in the halo producing leptons,
quarks, gluons, gauge bosons and Higgs bosons. The quarks, gauge
bosons and Higgs bosons will decay and/or form jets that will give
rise to antiprotons (and antineutrons which decay shortly to
antiprotons). Since antiprotons are not very abundant in the Universe,
this could in principle be a good signature for supersymmetric dark
matter. However, the cosmic rays (mainly protons) may produce
secondary antiprotons in collisions with the interstellar medium,
giving an important background. It was hoped that the difference in
kinematics between such secondary antiprotons and the primary ones
generated in neutralino annihilations would give an unambiguous
signature at low antiproton energy. However, recent calculations
indicate that other effects spoil this picture to a large degree
\cite{pbar,gaisserpbar}. It still remains true, however, that present
measurements and upper limits to the antiproton flux may be used as a
constraint to rule out some MSSM configurations with large rates.

Unfortunately, there is a larger uncertainty in
limits thus obtained than, for example, for the signal from neutrinos
from the Earth and Sun. This is due to the severe astrophysical
uncertainties about the phase space structure of the dark matter
halo, in particular the density profile towards the Galactic center.
This uncertainty will plague all indirect detection signals from
the halo: antiprotons, positrons and gamma-rays. Therefore, the
limits that can be put generally involve a combination of
MSSM and halo model parameters, and are therefore of limited use
constraining the MSSM alone.

At tree level the relevant final states for $\bar{p}$ production
are $q \bar{q}$, $\ell \bar{\ell}$, $W^{+} W^{-}$, $Z^{0} Z^{0}$,
$W^{+} H^{-}$, $Z H_{1}^{0}$, $Z H_{2}^{0}$, $H_{1}^{0} H_{3}^{0}$ and
$H_{2}^{0} H_{3}^{0}$. We have included in \ds\ all the heavier quarks ($c$,
$b$ and $t$), gauge bosons and Higgs boson final states.
  In addition, we have included the $Z \gamma$ (\cite{ub}) and
the 2 gluon (\cite{bua}; \cite{lp}) final states which occur at one
loop-level.


The hadronization and/or decay of all final states (including) gluons
is simulated with {\sc Pythia} as described in section \ref{sec:mcsim}.
A word of caution should be raised, however, that
antiproton data is not very abundant, in particular not at the
lowest antiproton lab energies which tend to dominate the signal.
Therefore an uncertainty in normalization, probably of the order of a
factor 2, cannot be excluded at least in the low energy region.

\subsection{The Antiproton Source Function}

The source function $Q_{\bar{p}}^{\chi}$ gives the number of antiprotons
per unit time, energy and volume element produced in annihilation
of neutralinos locally in space. It is given by
\begin{equation}
   Q_{\bar{p}}^{\chi}(T,\vec{x}\,)=
   (\sigma_{\rm ann}v)
   \left(\frac{\rho_{\chi}(\vec{x}\,)}{m_{\chi}}\right)^{2}
   \sum_{f}^{}\frac{dN^{f}}{dT}B^{f}
   \label{sourcefkn}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the $\bar{p}$ kinetic energy. For a given annihilation
channel $f$, $B^{f}$ and $dN^{f} / dT$ are, respectively, the branching ratio
and the fragmentation function, and $(\sigma_{\rm ann}v)$ is the
annihilation rate at $v=0$ (which is very good approximation since the
velocity of the neutralinos in the halo is so low).
As dark matter neutralinos annihilate in pairs, the source function is
proportional to the square of the neutralino number density
$n_{\chi} = \rho_{\chi} / m_{\chi}$.
Assuming that most of the dark matter in the Galaxy is made up of neutralinos
and that these are smoothly distributed in the halo, one can directly relate
the neutralino number density to the dark matter density profile in the
galactic halo $\rho$.
%
Although what is implemented is a smooth distribution of dark
matter particles in the halo, an extension to a clumpy distribution is
potentially interesting as well (\cite{clumpy}; \cite{pieroclumpy}).

\subsection{Propagation model}
\label{sec:prop}

In the absence of a well established theory to describe the
interactions of charged particles with the magnetic field of the
Galaxy and the interstellar medium, the propagation of cosmic rays has
generally been treated by postulating a semiempirical model and
fitting the necessary set of unknown parameters to available data.  A
common approach is to use a diffusion approximation defined by a
transport equation and an appropriate choice of boundary
conditions~(see e.g.\ \cite{Berezinskii}; \cite{Gaisserbook} and
references therein).

We have chosen to compute the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy by
means of a
  transport equation of the diffusion type
  (see \cite{Berezinskii}; \cite{Gaisserbook}).
In the case of a stationary solution, the number density $N$ of a
stable cosmic ray
species whose distribution of sources is defined by the function of
energy and space $Q(E,\vec{x})$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{N(E,\vec{x})}}{\partial{t}} = 0 = \nabla \cdot
\left(D(R,\vec{x})\,\nabla N(E,\vec{x})\right)
- \nabla \cdot \left( \vec{u}(\vec{x})\,N(E,\vec{x}) \right)
- p(E,\vec{x})\,N(E,\vec{x}) + Q(E,\vec{x}) \;\;.
\label{eq:diff}
\end{equation}

On the right hand side
of Eq.~(\ref{eq:diff}) the first term implements the diffusion approximation
for a given diffusion coefficient $D$, generally assumed to be a function of
rigidity $R$, while the second term describes a large-scale convective
motion of velocity $\vec{u}$. The third term is added to take into account
losses due to to collisions with the interstellar matter.
It is a very good approximation to include in this term only the interactions
with interstellar hydrogen, in this case
$p$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
p(E,\vec{x}) = n^H(\vec{x}) \, v(E) \, \sigma^{\rm in}_{cr\,p}(E)
\end{equation}
where $n^H$ is the hydrogen number density in the Galaxy, $v$ is the
velocity of the cosmic ray particle considered `$cr$', while
$\sigma^{\rm in}_{cr\,p}$ is the inelastic cross section for $cr$-proton
collisions.


The propagation region is assumed to have a cylindrical symmetry: the
Galaxy is split into two parts, a disk of radius $R_h$ and height
$2\cdot h_g$, where most of the interstellar gas is confined, and a
halo of height $2\cdot h_h$ and the same radius. We assume that the
diffusion coefficient is isotropic with possibly two different values
in the disk and in the halo, reflecting the fact that in the disk
there may be a larger random component of the magnetic fields.
The spatial dependence is then:
\begin{equation}
D(\vec{x}) = D(z) = D_g \, \theta(h_g - |z|) + D_h \, \theta(|z| - h_g)\;\;.
\end{equation}
Regarding the rigidity dependence,
we consider the same functional form as in
\cite{Chardonnet} and \cite{bottinolast}:
\begin{equation}
D_l(R) = D_l^0 \left(1+\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{0.6}
\label{eq:diffco}
\end{equation}
where $l=g,h$.

The convective term has been introduced in Eq.~(\ref{eq:diff}) to describe the
effect of particle motion against the wind of cosmic rays leaving the disk,
assuming a galactic wind of velocity
\begin{equation}
\vec{u}(\vec{x}) = \left(0, 0, u(z)\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
u(z)= {\rm sign}(z) \, u_h \, \theta(|z| - h_g)\;\;.
\end{equation}
An analytic solution is possible also in the case of a linearly increasing
wind~(\cite{pieroclumpy}).
The distribution of gas in the Galaxy is for convenience assumed
to have the very simple $z$ dependence
\begin{equation}
n^H(\vec{x}) = n^H(z)
= n_g^H \, \theta(h_g - |z|) + n_h^H \, \theta(|z| - h_g)
\end{equation}
where $n_h \ll n_g$ (in practice, $n_h=0$ is taken) and an average
in the radial direction is performed.

As boundary condition, it is usually assumed that cosmic rays can escape
freely at the border of the propagation region, i.e.\
\begin{equation}
N(R_h,z) = N(r,h_h) = N(r,-h_h) = 0
\label{eq:bound}
\end{equation}
as the density of cosmic rays is assumed to be negligibly small in the
intergalactic space.

The cylindrical symmetry and the free escape at the
boundaries makes it possible
to solve in \ds\
the transport equation expanding the number density distribution $N$
in a Fourier-Bessel series:
\begin{equation}
N(r,z,\theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \,\sum_{s=1}^{\infty} \;
J_k \left(\nu_s^k \frac{r}{R_h}\right) \cdot
\left[ M_s^k(z) \cos(k\theta) + \tilde{M}_s^k(z) \sin(k\theta)\right] \\
\end{equation}
which automatically satisfies the boundary condition at $r=R_h$,
$\nu_s^k$ being the $s$-th zero of $J_k$ (the Bessel function of the
first kind  and of order $k$).
In the same way the source function can be expanded as:
\begin{equation}
Q(r,z,\theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \,\sum_{s=1}^{\infty} \;
J_k \left(\nu_s^k \frac{r}{R_h}\right) \cdot
\left[ Q_s^k(z) \cos(k\theta) + \tilde{Q}_s^k(z) \sin(k\theta)\right]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
Q_s^k(z) = \frac{2}{{R_h}^2\,{J_{k+1}}^2(\nu_s^k)}
\int\limits_0^{R_h} dr^{\prime} \;r^{\prime}
J_k \left(\nu_s^k \frac{r^{\prime}}{R_h}\right)
\frac{1}{\alpha_k\,\pi}
\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\;\pi} d\theta^{\prime} \; \cos(k\theta^{\prime})
\,Q(r^{\prime},z,\theta^{\prime})\;\;.
\end{equation}
The equation relevant for the propagation in the $z$ direction is \cite{pbar}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}} D(z) \frac{\partial}{\partial{z}} M_s^k(z)
- D(z) \left(\frac{\nu_s^k}{R_h}\right)^2 M_s^k(z)
- \frac{\partial}{\partial{z}} \left(u(z)\,M_s^k(z) \right)
- p(z) M_s^k(z) + Q_s^k(z) =0 \;\;.
\end{equation}
For $-h_g \leq z \leq h_g$ the solution is given by:
\begin{equation}
M_s^k(z) = M_s^k(0) \cosh(\lambda_g^{ks} z) - \frac{1}{D_g\, \lambda_g^{ks}}
\int\limits_{0}^{z} \;dz^{\prime}
\sinh\left(\lambda_g^{ks} (z-z^{\prime})\right) Q_s^k(z^{\prime})
\label{eq:zdep}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
M_s^k(0) \ & = & \ \frac{1}{\cosh(\lambda_g^{ks} h_g)}
\left\{\frac{I_H}{\sinh\left(\lambda_h^{ks} (h_h-h_g)\right)}+
\frac{D_h\,I_{GS}}{D_g\, \lambda_g^{ks}} \,\left[\gamma_h +
\lambda_h^{ks} \coth\left(\lambda_h^{ks} (h_h-h_g)\right)\right]
+I_{GC}\right\} \nonumber \\
& & \times \left[D_g\,\lambda_g^{ks}\,\tanh\left(\lambda_g^{ks} h_g\right)
+ D_h\,\gamma_h + D_h\,\lambda_h^{ks}\,
\coth\left(\lambda_h^{ks} (h_h-h_g)\right) \right]^{-1}
\label{eq:halodiff}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_g^{ks} = \sqrt{\left({\nu_s^k\over R_h}\right)^2 +
\frac{n_g^H v \sigma^{\rm in}_{cr\,p}}{D_g}} \;,\;\;\;\;\
\lambda_h^{ks} = \sqrt{\left({\nu_s^k\over R_h}\right)^2 +
\frac{n_h^H v \sigma^{\rm in}_{cr\,p}}{D_h} + {\gamma_h}^2}\;,\;\;\;\; \
\gamma_h = \frac{u_h}{2\,D_h}
\label{eq:halodiff2}
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
I_H & = & \int\limits_{h_g}^{h_h} \;dz^{\prime} \,
\sinh\left(\lambda_h^{ks} (h_h-z^{\prime})\right) \,
\exp\left(\gamma_h (h_g-z^{\prime})\right)
\cdot \frac{Q_s^k(z^{\prime}) + Q_s^k(-z^{\prime})}{2} \nonumber \\
I_{GS} & = & \int\limits_{0}^{h_g} \;dz^{\prime} \,
\sinh\left(\lambda_g^{ks} (h_g-z^{\prime})\right)
\cdot \frac{Q_s^k(z^{\prime}) + Q_s^k(-z^{\prime})}{2} \nonumber \\
I_{GC} & = & \int\limits_{0}^{h_g} \;dz^{\prime} \,
\cosh\left(\lambda_g^{ks} (h_g-z^{\prime})\right)
\cdot \frac{Q_s^k(z^{\prime}) + Q_s^k(-z^{\prime})}{2} \;.
\label{eq:int}
\end{eqnarray}

In \ds\ we have also as an option included the propagation models by
Chardonnay et al.\ \cite{chardonnay} and Bottino et al.\
\cite{bottinopbar}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Solar Modulation}

A complication when comparing predictions of a theoretical
model with data on cosmic rays taken at Earth is given by the solar
modulation effect. During their propagation from the interstellar
medium through the solar system, charged particles are affected by the
solar wind and tend to lose energy. The net result of the modulation
is a shift in energy between the interstellar spectrum and the
spectrum at the Earth and a substantial depletion of particles with
non-relativistic energies.

The simplest way to describe the phenomenon is the analytical force-field
approximation by Gleeson \& Axford \cite{GleesonAxford} for a spherically
symmetric model. The prescription of
this effective treatment is that, given an interstellar flux at the
heliospheric boundary, $d\Phi_{\rm b}/dT_{\rm b}$, the flux at the Earth
is related to this by
\begin{equation}
   \frac{d\Phi_{\oplus}}{dT_\oplus}(T_\oplus) = \frac{p_\oplus^2}{p_{\rm
   b}^2} \frac{d\Phi_{\rm b}}{dT_{\rm b}} (T_{\rm b})
\end{equation}
where the energy at the heliospheric boundary is given by
\begin{equation}
   E_{\rm b} = E_\oplus + |Ze|\phi_F
\end{equation}
and $p_{\otimes}$ and $p_{\rm b}$ are the momenta at the Earth and
the heliospheric boundary respectively.
Here $e$ is the absolute value of the electron charge and $Z$ the
particle charge in units of $e$ (e.g.\ $Z=-1$ for antiprotons).

An alternative approach is to solve numerically the propagation equation
of the spherically symmetric model~(\cite{fisk}): the solar modulation
parameter one has to introduce with this method roughly corresponds to
$\phi_F$ as given above. When computing solar modulated antiproton fluxes,
the two treatments seem not to be completely equivalent in the low energy
regime. Keeping this in mind, we have
anyway
implemented the force field approximation in \ds\, avoiding the
CPU time-consuming problem of
having to solve a partial differential equation for each
supersymmetric model.

\section{Relic density -- theoretical background}

\subsection{The Boltzmann equation and thermal averaging}
\label{sec:Boltzmann}

Griest and Seckel \cite{GriestSeckel} have worked out the Boltzmann
equation when coannihilations are included. We start by reviewing
their expressions and then continue by rewriting them into a more
convenient form that resembles the familiar case without
coannihilations. This allows us to use similar expressions for
calculating thermal averages and solving the Boltzmann equation
whether coannihilations are included or not. The implementation in
\ds\ is based upon the work done in \cite{edsjo97}. We will later in this
chapter, for the sake of clarification, assume that we work with
supersymmetric dark matter with the lightest neutralino being the
LSP. The routines here are completely general though and the interface
between supersymmetry and the relic density routines is handled by the
routines in \codeb{src/rn}.


\subsection{Review of the Boltzmann equation with coannihilations}

Consider annihilation of $N$ supersymmetric particles $\chi_i$
($i=1,\ldots,N$) with masses $m_i$ and internal degrees of freedom
(statistical weights) $g_i$.  Also assume that $m_1 \leq m_2 \leq
\cdots \leq m_{N-1} \leq m_N$ and that $R$-parity is conserved. Note
that for the mass of the lightest neutralino we will use the
notation $m_{\chi}$ and $m_{1}$ interchangeably.

The evolution of the number density $n_i$ of particle $i$ is
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:Boltzmann}
  \frac{dn_{i}}{dt} 
  &=& 
  -3 H n_{i} 
  - \sum_{j=1}^N \langle \sigma_{ij} v_{ij} \rangle 
    \left( n_{i} n_{j} - n_{i}^{\rm{eq}} n_{j}^{\rm{eq}} \right) 
  \nonumber \\ 
  & & 
  - \sum_{j\ne i} 
  \big[ \langle \sigma'_{Xij} v_{ij} \rangle 
        \left( n_i n_X - n_{i}^{\rm{eq}} n_{X}^{\rm{eq}} \right)
      - \langle \sigma'_{Xji} v_{ij} \rangle
        \left( n_j n_X - n_{j}^{\rm{eq}} n_{X}^{\rm{eq}} \right)
  \big]
  \nonumber \\ 
  & &
  - \sum_{j\ne i} 
  \big[ \Gamma_{ij} 
        \left( n_i - n_i^{\rm{eq}} \right) 
      - \Gamma_{ji} 
        \left( n_j - n_j^{\rm{eq}} \right) 
  \big] .
\end{eqnarray}
The first term on the right-hand side is the dilution due to the
expansion of the Universe. $H$ is the Hubble parameter. The second
term describes $\chi_i\chi_j$ annihilations, whose total
annihilation cross section is 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma_{ij}  & = & \sum_X \sigma (\chi_i \chi_j \rightarrow X).
\end{eqnarray}
The third term describes $\chi_i \to \chi_j$ conversions by
scattering off the cosmic thermal background,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma'_{Xij} & = & \sum_Y \sigma (\chi_i X \rightarrow \chi_j Y)
\end{eqnarray}
being the inclusive scattering cross section. The last term accounts
for $\chi_i$ decays, with inclusive decay rates 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Gamma_{ij}  & = & \sum_X \Gamma (\chi_i \rightarrow \chi_j X).
\end{eqnarray}
In the previous expressions, $X$ and $Y$
are (sets of) standard model particles involved in the
interactions, $v_{ij}$ is the `relative velocity' defined by
\begin{equation}
  v_{ij} = \frac{\sqrt{(p_{i} \cdot p_{j})^2-m_{i}^2 m_{j}^2}}{E_{i} E_{j}}
\end{equation}
with $p_{i}$ and $E_{i}$ being the four-momentum and energy of 
particle $i$, and finally $n_{i}^{\rm{eq}}$ is the equilibrium number
density of particle $\chi_i$,
\begin{equation}
  n_{i}^{\rm{eq}} = \frac{g_{i}}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3{\bf p}_{i}f_{i}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf p}_i$ is the three-momentum of particle $i$, and
 $f_i$ is its equilibrium distribution function. 
In the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation it is given by
\begin{equation}
  f_{i} = e^{-E_{i}/T}.
\end{equation}
The thermal average $\langle\sigma_{ij}v_{ij}\rangle$ is defined
with equilibrium distributions and is given by
\begin{equation}
  \langle \sigma_{ij}v_{ij} \rangle = \frac{\int d^3{\bf
      p}_{i}d^3{\bf p}_{j} 
  f_{i}f_{j}\sigma_{ij}v_{ij}}
  {\int d^3{\bf p}_{i}d^3{\bf p}_{j}f_{i}f_{j}}
\end{equation}

Normally, the decay rate of supersymmetric particles $\chi_i$ other
than the lightest which is stable is much faster than the age of the
universe. Since we have assumed $R$-parity conservation, all of these
particles decay into the lightest one. So its final abundance is
simply described by the sum of the density of all supersymmetric
particles,
\begin{equation}
  n= \sum_{i=1}^N n_{i}.
\end{equation}
For $n$ we get the following evolution equation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dn}{dt} = -3Hn - \sum_{i,j=1}^N \langle \sigma_{ij} v_{ij} \rangle 
  \left( n_{i}n_{j} - n_{i}^{\rm{eq}}n_{j}^{\rm{eq}} \right)
\end{equation}
where the terms on the second and third lines in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann}) cancel in the sum. 

The scattering rate of supersymmetric particles off particles in the
thermal background is much faster than their annihilation rate,
because the scattering cross sections $\sigma'_{Xij}$ are of the same
order of magnitude as the annihilation cross sections $\sigma_{ij}$
but the background particle density $n_X$ is much larger than each of
the supersymmetric particle densities $n_i$ when the former are
relativistic and the latter are non-relativistic, and so suppressed by
a Boltzmann factor. In this case, the $\chi_i$ distributions remain in
thermal equilibrium, and in particular their ratios are equal to the
equilibrium values,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{n_{i}}{n} \simeq \frac{n_{i}^{\rm{eq}}}{n^{\rm{eq}}}.
\end{equation}
We then get
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Boltzmann2}
  \frac{dn}{dt} =
  -3Hn - \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle 
  \left( n^2 - n_{\rm{eq}}^2 \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sigmaveffdef}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle = \sum_{ij} \langle
  \sigma_{ij}v_{ij} \rangle \frac{n_{i}^{\rm{eq}}}{n^{\rm{eq}}}
  \frac{n_{j}^{\rm{eq}}}{n^{\rm{eq}}}.
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Thermal averaging}
\label{sec:thermav}

So far the reviewing. Now let's continue
by reformulating the thermal averages into
more convenient expressions. 

We rewrite Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigmaveffdef}) as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sigmaveff}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle = \frac{ \sum_{ij} \langle
  \sigma_{ij}v_{ij} \rangle n_{i}^{\rm{eq}} n_{j}^{\rm{eq}}}{n^2_{\rm{eq}}}
  = 
  \frac{A}{n_{\rm{eq}}^2} \, .
\end{equation}

For the denominator we obtain, 
using Boltzmann statistics for $f_i$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:neq}
  n^{\rm eq} = \sum_i n^{\rm eq}_i = 
  \sum_i \frac{g_i}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 p_i 
  e^{-E_{i}/T} = 
  \frac{T}{2\pi^2} \sum_i g_i m_{i}^2
  K_{2} \left( \frac{m_{i}}{T}\right)
\end{equation}
where $K_{2}$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of 
order 2.

The numerator is the total annihilation rate per unit volume
at temperature $T$,
\begin{equation} 
  A = \sum_{ij} \langle \sigma_{ij} v_{ij} \rangle n_i^{\rm eq}
  n_j^{\rm eq} = \sum_{ij} \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{(2\pi)^6} \int d^3 {\bf p}_{i}
  d^3{\bf p}_{j} f_{i}f_{j} \sigma_{ij} v_{ij}
\end{equation}
It is convenient
to cast it in a covariant form,
\begin{equation} 
  A = \sum_{ij} 
  \int W_{ij} \frac{g_i f_i d^3{\bf p}_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i}
  \frac{g_j f_j d^3{\bf p}_j}{(2\pi)^3 2E_j} .
\label{eq:Aij2}
\end{equation}
$W_{ij}$ is the (unpolarized) annihilation rate per unit volume
corresponding to the covariant normalization of $2E$ colliding
particles per unit volume. $W_{ij}$ is a dimensionless Lorentz
invariant, related to the (unpolarized) cross section
through\footnote{The quantity $w_{ij}$ in Ref.\ \protect\cite{SWO}
  is $W_{ij}/4$.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Wijcross}
  W_{ij} = 4 p_{ij} \sqrt{s} \sigma_{ij} = 4 \sigma_{ij} \sqrt{(p_i
\cdot p_j)^2 - m_i^2 m_j^2} = 4 E_{i} E_{j} \sigma_{ij} v_{ij} .
\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}
  p_{ij} =
\frac{\left[s-(m_i+m_j)^2\right]^{1/2}
\left[s-(m_i-m_j)^2\right]^{1/2}}{2\sqrt{s}}
\end{equation}
is the momentum of particle $\chi_i$ (or $\chi_j$) in the
center-of-mass frame of the pair $\chi_i\chi_j$.

Averaging over initial and summing over final internal states, the
contribution to $W_{ij}$ of a general $n$-body final state is
\begin{equation}
  W^{n\rm{-body}}_{ij} = 
  \frac{1}{g_i g_j S_f} \sum_{\rm{internal~d.o.f.}} 
  \int  \left| {\cal M} \right|^2 (2\pi)^4 
\delta^4(p_i+p_j-{\textstyle \sum_f}p_f) \prod_f
   \frac{d^3{\bf p}_f}{(2\pi)^3 2E_f} , 
\end{equation}
where $S_f$ is a symmetry factor accounting for identical final state
particles (if there are $K$ sets of $N_k$ identical particles,
$k=1,\dots,K$, then $S_f = \prod_{k=1}^{K} N_k!$).  In particular, 
the contribution
of a two-body final state can be written as
\begin{equation}
  W^{\rm{2-body}}_{ij\to kl} = \frac{p_{kl}}{16\pi^2 g_i g_j S_{kl} \sqrt{s}}
  \sum_{\rm{internal~d.o.f.}} \int \left| {\cal M}(ij\to kl) \right|^2
  d\Omega ,
\end{equation}
where $p_{kl}$ is the final center-of-mass momentum, $S_{kl}$ is a
symmetry factor equal to 2 for identical final particles and to 1
otherwise, and the integration is over the outgoing directions of
one of the final particles.  As usual, an average over initial
internal degrees of freedom is performed.

We now reduce the integral in the covariant expression for $A$,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Aij2}), from 6 dimensions to 1.
Using Boltzmann statistics for $f_i$ (a good approximation for
$T\lsim m$)
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Aij2b}
  A =
  \sum_{ij} \int g_i g_j W_{ij} e^{-E_{i}/T} e^{-E_{j}/T} 
\frac{d^3{\bf p}_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i}
  \frac{d^3{\bf p}_j}{(2\pi)^3 2E_j} ,
\end{equation}
where ${\bf p}_{i}$ and ${\bf p}_{j}$ are the three-momenta and
$E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are the energies of the colliding particles.
Following the procedure in Ref.~\cite{GondoloGelmini} we then rewrite
the momentum volume element as
\begin{equation}
  d^3 {\bf p}_{i} d^3 {\bf p}_{j} = 4 \pi |{\bf p}_{i}| E_i dE_{i}
  \, 4 \pi |{\bf p}_{j}| E_j dE_{j} \, \frac{1}{2} d \cos \theta
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle between ${\bf p}_{i}$ and 
${\bf p}_{j}$. Then we change integration variables from 
$E_{i}$, $E_{j}$, $\theta$ to $E_{+}$, $E_{-}$ and $s$, given by
\begin{equation}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
  E_{+} & = & E_{i}+E_{j} \\
  E_{-} & = & E_{i}-E_{j} \\
  s & = & m_{i}^2+m_{j}^2 + 2E_{i}E_{j}-2 |{\bf p}_{i}| |{\bf
    p}_{j}| \cos \theta,
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
whence the volume element becomes
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^3{\bf p}_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i} \frac{d^3{\bf p}_j}{(2\pi)^3 2E_j} =
  \frac{1}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{dE_{+}dE_{-}ds}{8},
\end{equation}
and the integration region $\{ E_i \geq m_i, E_j \geq m_j, |\cos \theta| 
\leq
1\}$ transforms into 
\begin{eqnarray}
  && s \geq (m_i+m_j)^2, \\ && E_{+} \geq \sqrt{s} , \\ && \left\vert
  E_{-} - E_{+} \frac{m_j^2-m_i^2}{s} \right\vert \leq 2 p_{ij}
  \sqrt{\frac{E_{+}^2-s}{s}}.
\end{eqnarray}

Notice now that the product of the equilibrium distribution
functions depends only on $E_{+}$ and not $E_{-}$ due to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, and that the invariant rate
$W_{ij}$ depends only on $s$ due to the neglect of final state
statistical factors. Hence we can immediately integrate over
$E_{-}$,
\begin{equation}
  \int dE_{-} = 4p_{ij} \sqrt{\frac{E_{+}^2-s}{s}}.
\end{equation}
The volume element is now
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^3{\bf p}_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i} \frac{d^3{\bf p}_j}{(2\pi)^3 2E_j} = 
  \frac{1}{(2\pi)^4} \frac{p_{ij}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{E_{+}^2-s}{s}} 
dE_{+} ds 
\end{equation}

We now perform the $E_{+}$ integration. We obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:As}
  A = \frac{T}{32 \pi^4} \sum_{ij} \int_{(m_i+m_j)^2}^\infty ds
  g_ig_jp_{ij} W_{ij} K_{1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{T}\right)
\end{equation}
where $K_{1}$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of 
order 1.

We can take the sum inside the integral and define an effective
annihilation rate $W_{\rm eff}$ through
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{ij} g_i g_j p_{ij} W_{ij} = g_1^2 p_{\rm{eff}} W_{\rm{eff}}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:peff}
  p_{\rm{eff}} = p_{11} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{s-4m_{1}^2} .
\end{equation}
In other words
\begin{equation} \label{eq:weff}
  W_{\rm{eff}} = \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}}
  \frac{g_ig_j}{g_1^2} W_{ij} = 
  \sum_{ij} \sqrt{\frac{[s-(m_{i}-m_{j})^2][s-(m_{i}+m_{j})^2]}
  {s(s-4m_1^2)}} \frac{g_ig_j}{g_1^2} W_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Because $W_{ij}(s) = 0 $ for $s \le (m_i+m_j)^2$, the radicand is  
never negative.

In terms of cross sections, this is equivalent to the definition
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm eff} = \sum_{ij} \frac{p^2_{ij}}{p^2_{11}}
  \frac{g_ig_j}{g_1^2} \sigma_{ij}.
\end{equation}  

Eq.~(\ref{eq:As}) then reads
\begin{equation}
  A = \frac{g_1^2 T}{32 \pi^4} \int_{4m_1^2}^\infty ds
  p_{\rm eff} W_{\rm eff} K_{1} \left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{T}\right)
\end{equation}
This can be written in a form more suitable
for numerical integration by using $p_{\rm{eff}}$ instead of $s$ as
integration variable.  From Eq.~(\ref{eq:peff}), we have 
 $ ds = 8 p_{\rm{eff}} dp_{\rm{eff}} $, and 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Apeff}
  A = \frac{g_1^2 T}{4 \pi^4} \int_{0}^\infty dp_{\rm eff}
  p^2_{\rm eff} W_{\rm eff} K_{1} 
  \left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{T}\right)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  s = 4p_{\rm{eff}}^2 + 4m_1^2
\end{equation}
So we have succeeded in rewriting $A$ as a 1-dimensional integral.

{}From Eqs.~(\ref{eq:Apeff}) and~(\ref{eq:neq}), the thermal average of
the effective cross section results
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sigmavefffin2}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}}v \rangle = \frac{\int_0^\infty
  dp_{\rm{eff}} p_{\rm{eff}}^2 W_{\rm{eff}} K_1 \left(
  \frac{\sqrt{s}}{T} \right) } { m_1^4 T \left[ \sum_i \frac{g_i}{g_1}
  \frac{m_i^2}{m_1^2} K_2 \left(\frac{m_i}{T}\right) \right]^2}.
\end{equation}
This expression is very similar to the case without coannihilations,
the differences being the denominator and the replacement of the
annihilation rate with the effective annihilation rate. 
In the absence of coannihilations, this expression
correctly reduces to the formula in Gondolo and
Gelmini~\cite{GondoloGelmini}.

The definition of an effective annihilation rate independent of
temperature is a remarkable calculational advantage. As in the case
without coannihilations, the effective annihilation rate can in fact
be tabulated in advance, before taking the thermal average and
solving the Boltzmann equation.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\epsfig{file=fig/rateex.eps,width=0.75\textwidth}}
  \caption{The effective invariant annihiliation rate $W_{\rm eff}$
    as a function of $p_{\rm eff}$ for an example model. 
    The final state threshold for
    annihilation into $W^+ W^-$ and the coannihilation thresholds, as
    given by Eq.~(\protect\ref{eq:weff}), are indicated.  
    The $\chi_2^0 \chi_2^0$ coannihilation threshold is too small to
    be seen.}
  \label{fig:effrate}
\end{figure}

In the effective annihilation rate, coannihilations appear
as thresholds at $\sqrt{s}$ equal to the sum of the masses of the
coannihilating particles.  We show an example in
Fig.~\ref{fig:effrate} where it is clearly seen that the
coannihilation thresholds appear in the effective invariant rate
just as final state thresholds do.  For the same example,
Fig.~\ref{fig:k1effrate} shows the differential annihilation rate
per unit volume $dA/dp_{\rm eff}$, the integrand in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Apeff}), as a function of $p_{\rm eff}$. We have
chosen a temperature $T=m_{\chi}/20$, a typical freeze-out
temperature. The Boltzmann suppression contained in the exponential
decay of $K_{1}$ at high $p_{\rm eff}$ is clearly visible.  At
higher temperatures the peak shifts to the right and at lower
temperatures to the left.  For the particular model shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:effrate}--\ref{fig:k1effrate}, the relic density
results $\Omega_\chi h^2=0.030$ when coannihilations are included
and $\Omega_\chi h^2=0.18$ when they are not. Coannihilations
have lowered $\Omega_\chi h^2$ by a factor of 6.

\subsection{Internal degrees of freedom}
\label{sec:dof}

If we look at Eqs.~(\ref{eq:weff}) and (\ref{eq:sigmavefffin2}) we see
that we have a freedom on how to treat particles degenerate in mass,
e.g.\ a chargino can be treated either 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)]
  as two separate species
  $\chi_{i}^+$ and $\chi_{i}^-$, each with internal degrees of freedom
  $g_{\chi^+}=g_{\chi^-}=2$, or,
\item[b)]
  as a single species
  $\chi_{i}^\pm$ with $g_{\chi_{i}^\pm}=4$ internal degrees of freedom. 
\end{enumerate}
Of course the two views are equivalent, we just have to be careful 
including the $g_{i}$'s consistently whichever view we take.
In a), we have the advantage that all the $W_{ij}$ that enter into 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) enter as they are, i.e.\ without any correction 
factors for the degrees of freedom. On the other hand we get many 
terms in the sum that are identical and we need some book-keeping 
machinery to avoid calculating identical terms more than once. On the 
other hand, with option b), the sum over $W_{ij}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) 
is much simpler only containing terms that are not identical (except 
for the trivial identity $W_{ij}=W_{ji}$ which is easily taken care of). 
However, the individual $W_{ij}$ will be some linear combinations of 
the more basic $W_{ij}$ entering in option a), where the coefficients 
have to be calculated for each specific type of initial condition. 

Below we will perform this calculation to show how the $W_{ij}$ look 
like in option b) for different initial states. We will use a prime on 
the $W_{ij}$ when they refer to these combined states to indicate the 
difference.

%%%%%
\subsubsection{Neutralino-chargino annihilation}

The starting point is Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) which we will use to define 
the $W_{ij}$ in option b) such that $W_{\rm eff}$ is the same as in 
option a). Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigmavefffin2}) is then guaranteed to be the 
same in both cases since the sum in the denominator is linear in $g_{i}$.

Now consider annihilation between $\chi_{i}^0$ and $\chi_{c}^+$ or 
$\chi_{c}^-$. The corresponding terms in Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) does for 
option a) read
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{ic}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^-} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{i}^0}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{i}^0}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^-}}
    \bigg] \nonumber \\
    & = & 2 \frac{p_{ic}}{p_{11}} 
    \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^-}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+}}
    \bigg]
    = 4 \frac{p_{ic}}{p_{11}} 
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+}
    \label{eq:weffneucha-a}
\end{eqnarray}

For option b), we instead get
\begin{equation}
    W_{\rm eff} = \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{ic}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 4}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^\pm} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{i}^0}}_{W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^\pm}}
    \bigg]
    =
    4 \frac{p_{ic}}{p_{11}} W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^\pm}
    \label{eq:weffneucha-b}
\end{equation}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffneucha-b}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffneucha-a}) 
we see that they are indentical if we make the identification
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^\pm} \equiv W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{c}^+}
\end{equation}

%%%%%
\subsubsection{Chargino-chargino annihilation}

First consider the case where we include the terms in the sum for 
which we have annihilation between $\chi_{c}^+$ or $\chi_{c}^-$ and 
$\chi_{d}^+$ or $\chi_{d}^-$ with $c \ne d$.

In option a), the corresponding terms in Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij} \nonumber \\
    & = &
    \frac{p_{cd}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^-} \nonumber \\
    & & +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{d}^+ \chi_{c}^+}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{d}^+ \chi_{c}^-}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^+}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{d}^- \chi_{c}^+}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{d}^- \chi_{c}^-}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^-}}
    \bigg] \nonumber \\
    & = & 
    2 \frac{p_{cd}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^+}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{d}^-}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+}}
    \bigg] \nonumber \\
    & = & 
    4 \frac{p_{cd}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-}
    \bigg]
    \label{eq:weffchacha-a}
\end{eqnarray}
In option b), the corresponding terms would instead read
\begin{equation}
    W_{\rm eff} = \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij} =
    \frac{p_{cd}}{p_{11}} \frac{4 \cdot 4}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{d}^\pm} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\chi_{d}^\pm \chi_{c}^\pm}}_{W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{d}^\pm}}
    \bigg]
     = 8 \frac{p_{cd}}{p_{11}} W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{d}^\pm}
    \label{eq:weffchacha-b}
\end{equation}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchacha-a}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchacha-b}) 
we see that they are identical if we make the following identifcation
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{d}^\pm} \equiv \frac{1}{2} 
        \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{d}^-}
    \bigg]
\end{equation} 

For clarity, let's also consider the case where $c=d$.
In option a), the terms in $W_{\rm eff}$ are
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{cc}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^-} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{c}^+}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^-}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \chi_{c}^-}}_{W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^+}}
    \bigg] 
    \nonumber \\
    & = &
    2 \frac{p_{cc}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^-}
    \bigg]
    \label{eq:weffchacha-a-ident}
\end{eqnarray}
In option b), the corresponding term would instead read
\begin{equation}
    W_{\rm eff} = \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij} =
    \frac{p_{cc}}{p_{11}} \frac{4 \cdot 4}{2^2}
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{c}^\pm} +
     = 4 \frac{p_{cc}}{p_{11}} W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{c}^\pm}
    \label{eq:weffchacha-b-ident}
\end{equation}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchacha-a-ident}) and 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchacha-b-ident}) 
we see that they are identical if we make the following identifcation
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \chi_{c}^\pm} \equiv \frac{1}{2} 
        \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^+} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \chi_{c}^-}
    \bigg]
\end{equation} 
i.e.\ the same identification as in the case $c \ne d$.

\subsubsection{Neutralino-sfermion annihilation}

For each sfermion we have in total four different states,
$\tilde{f}_{1}$, $\tilde{f}_{2}$, $\tilde{f}_{1}^{*}$ and
$\tilde{f}_{2}^{*}$.  Of these, the $\tilde{f}_{1}$ and
$\tilde{f}_{2}$ in general have different masses and have to be treated
separately.  Considering only one mass eigenstate $\tilde{f}_{k}$,
option a) then means that we treat $\tilde{f}_{k}$ and
$\tilde{f}_{k}^{*}$ as two separate species with $g_{i}=1$ degree of
freedom each, whereas option b) means that we treat them as one
species $\tilde{f}'_{k}$ with $g_{i}=2$ degrees of freedom.  As
before, the prime indicates that we mean both the particle and the
antiparticle state.

Note, that for squarks we also have the number of colours $N_c=3$ to take into account.
In option a) we should choose to treat even colour state differently, i.e.\ $g_i=1$, whereas $g_i=6$ in case b). 
The expressions would be the same as above except that both the expression in a) and b) would be multiplied by the colour factor $N_c=3$. The expression relating case a) and case b) is thus unaffected by this colour factor. Note however, that in option b) we take the average over the squark colours (or in this case calculate it only for one colour. See sections \ref{sec:sqsq} and \ref{sec:sfsq} below for more details.

For option a), Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) then reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{ik}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}} +
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}^*} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \chi_{i}^0}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \chi_{i}^0}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}^*}}
    \bigg] 
    \nonumber \\
    & = &
    \frac{p_{ik}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}^*}}_{W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}}}
    \bigg]
    =
    2 \frac{p_{ik}}{p_{11}}
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}}
    \label{eq:weffneusf-a}
\end{eqnarray}
whereas for option b), Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) reads
\begin{equation}
    W_{\rm eff} = \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{ik}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f'}_{k}} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \chi_{i}^0}}_{W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f'}_{k}}}
    \bigg] 
    =
    2 \frac{p_{ik}}{p_{11}}
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f'}_{k}}
    \label{eq:weffneusf-b}
\end{equation}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffneusf-b}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffneusf-a}) we 
see that they are indentical if we make the identification
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f'}_{k}} \equiv W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}}
\end{equation}

For clarity, for squarks the corresponding expression would be
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{q'}_{k}} \equiv
   \frac{1}{3}\sum_{a=1}^3 W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{q}_{k}^a}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a colour index.

%%%%%
\subsubsection{Chargino-sfermion annihilation}

In option a) the chargino has $g_i=2$ and the sfermion has $g_i=1$ degrees of freedom, whereas in option b), the chargino has $g_i=4$ and the sfermion has $g_i=2$ degrees of freedom

For option a), Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) then reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij} \nonumber \\

      {W_{\chi_{c}^- \tilde{f}_{k}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^* \chi_{c}^-}}_
      {W_{\chi_{c}^- \tilde{f}_{k}^*}}
    \bigg] \nonumber \\
    & = &
    \frac{p_{ck}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}^*} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \tilde{f}_{k}}}_
      {W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}^*}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\chi_{c}^- \tilde{f}_{k}^*}}_
      {W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}}}
    \bigg]
    = 
    2 \frac{p_{ck}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}} +
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}^*} \bigg]
    \label{eq:weffchasf-a}
\end{eqnarray}

In option b), Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij}
    =
    \frac{p_{ck}}{p_{11}} \frac{4 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{f'}_{k}} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \chi_{c}^\pm}}_
      {W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{f'}_{k}}} \bigg]
    = 4 \frac{p_{ck}}{p_{11}} W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{f'}_{k}}
    \label{eq:weffchasf-b}
\end{eqnarray}

Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchasf-b}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffchasf-a}) we 
see that they are indentical if we make the identification
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{f'}_{k}} \equiv
    \frac{1}{2} \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}} + 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}^*}
    \bigg] 
\end{equation}

For clarity, for squarks the corresponding expression would be
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{q'}_{k}} \equiv
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{3}\sum_{a=1}^3 \bigg[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{q}_{k}^a} + 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{q}_{k}^{a*}}
    \bigg] 
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a colour index.


%%%%%
\subsubsection{Sfermion-sfermion annihilation}

First consider the case where we have annihilation between sfmerions 
of different types, i.e.\ annihilation between $\tilde{f}_{k}$ or 
$\tilde{f}_{k}^{*}$ and $\tilde{f}_{l}$ or $\tilde{f}_{l}^{*}$.

For option a), Eq.~(\ref{eq:weff}) then reads
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}} +
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}} +
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}} +
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}} \nonumber \\
    & & +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{l} \tilde{f}_{k}}}_
       {W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{l} \tilde{f}_{k}^{*}}}_
       {W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{l}^{*} \tilde{f}_{k}}}_
       {W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{l}^{*} \tilde{f}_{k}^{*}}}_
       {W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}}}
    \bigg]  \nonumber \\
    & = &
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}} +
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}}}_
        {W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{f}_{k}^{*} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}}}_
        {W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}}}
    \bigg] 
    = \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}}
    \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}} +
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^{*}}
    \bigg] \label{eq:weffsfsf-a}
\end{eqnarray}    

In option b) we would get 
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij}
    \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{f'}_{l}} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\tilde{f'}_{l} \tilde{f'}_{k}}}_
       {W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{f'}_{l}}} \bigg]
    = 2 \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \bigg[
    W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{f'}_{l}}\bigg]
    \label{eq:weffsfsf-b}
\end{eqnarray}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffsfsf-b}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffsfsf-a}) we 
see that they are indentical if we make the identification
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{f'}_{l}} \equiv 
    \frac{1}{2} \bigg[
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}} + 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^*} \bigg] 
\end{equation}
It is easy to show that this relation holds true even if $k=l$.

\subsubsection{Squark-squark annihilation}
\label{sec:sqsq}

Even though we treated sfermion-sfermion annihilation in the previous subsection, squarks have colour which can complicate things, so let's for clarity consider squarks separately.

Let's denote the squarks $\tilde{q}_k^a$ where $a$ is now a colour index. In option a) we will let each colour be a seprate species, which means that $g_i=1$ in this case. In option b) we will instead have $g_i=6$.

In option a) we would have 
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W_{ij}
    \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2^2}
    \sum_{a,b=1}^3 \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^b} +
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}} +
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^b} +
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}} \nonumber \\
    & & +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{q}_{l}^a \tilde{q}_{k}^b}}_

       {W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^b}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{q}_{l}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{k}^b}}_
       {W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{q}_{l}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{k}^{b*}}}_
       {W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}}}
    \bigg]  \nonumber \\
    & = &
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}}
    \sum_{a,b=1}^3 \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{f}_{l}^b} +
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{f}_{l}^{b*}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^b}}_
        {W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}}} +
    \underbrace{W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^{a*} \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}}}_
        {W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^b}}
    \bigg] 
    = \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}}
    \sum_{a,b=1}^3 \bigg[ 
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^b} +
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}}
    \bigg] \label{eq:weffsqsq-a}
\end{eqnarray}    

In option b) we would get 
\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{\rm eff} & = & \sum_{ij}\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{11}} 
    \frac{g_{i}g_{j}}{g_{1}^2} W'_{ij}
    \nonumber \\
    & = & \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \frac{6 \cdot 6}{2^2}
    \bigg[ 
    W'_{\tilde{q'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}} +
    \underbrace{W'_{\tilde{q'}_{l} \tilde{q'}_{k}}}_
       {W'_{\tilde{q'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}}} \bigg]
    = 18 \frac{p_{kl}}{p_{11}} \bigg[
    W'_{\tilde{q'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}}\bigg]
    \label{eq:weffsqsq-b}
\end{eqnarray}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffsqsq-b}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:weffsqsq-a}) we 
see that they are indentical if we make the identification
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\tilde{q'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}} \equiv 
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{9}\sum_{a,b=1}^3 \bigg[
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^b} + 
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}} \bigg] 
\end{equation}
i.e. we get the same relation as for other sfermions, the only difference being that
we in option b) should also take the average over the colour states.

\subsubsection{Sfermion-squark annihilation}
\label{sec:sfsq}

For clarity, if we have annihilation between a non-coloured sfermion and a squark, we would in the same way as in the previous subsection get
\begin{equation}
    W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}} \equiv 
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{3}\sum_{b=1}^3 \bigg[
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{q}_{l}^b} + 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}} \bigg] 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Summary of degrees of freedom}

We have found above the following relations between option b) and option a),
\begin{equation}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
% neutralino-chargino
  W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{j}^\pm} & \equiv & W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{j}^+} = 
    W_{\chi_{i}^0 \chi_{j}^-} \quad , \quad \forall\ i=1,\ldots,4,\ 
    j=1,2 \anl
% chargino-chargino
  W'_{\chi_{i}^\pm \chi_{j}^\pm} & \equiv & \frac{1}{2} 
  \left[ W_{\chi_{i}^+ \chi_{j}^+} +  
  W_{\chi_{i}^+ \chi_{j}^-}\right] = 
  \frac{1}{2} \left[ W_{\chi_{i}^- \chi_{j}^-} +  
  W_{\chi_{i}^- \chi_{j}^+}\right] \quad , \quad \forall\ i=1,2,\ j=1,2 \anl
% neutralino-sfermion
  W'_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f'}_{k}} & \equiv & W_{\chi_{i}^0 \tilde{f}_{k}}
  \quad , \quad \forall i=1,\ldots 4,\ k=1,2 \anl
% chargino-sfermion
  W'_{\chi_{c}^\pm \tilde{f'}_{k}} & \equiv &
    \frac{1}{2} \left[ 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}} + 
    W_{\chi_{c}^+ \tilde{f}_{k}^*}
    \right]
  \quad , \quad \forall c=1,2,\ k=1,2 \anl
% sfermion-sfmerion
  W'_{\tilde{f'}_{k} \tilde{f'}_{l}} & \equiv & 
    \frac{1}{2} \left[
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}} + 
    W_{\tilde{f}_{k} \tilde{f}_{l}^*} \right] 
  \quad , \quad \forall k=1,2,\ l=1,2 \anl
% squark-squark
  W'_{\tilde{q'}_{k} \tilde{q'}_{l}} & \equiv & 
    \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{9}\sum_{a,b=1}^3 \left[
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^b} + 
    W_{\tilde{q}_{k}^a \tilde{q}_{l}^{b*}} \right] 
  \quad , \quad \forall k=1,2,\ l=1,2
  \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}
We don't list all the possible cases with squarks explicitly, the principle being that we in option b) should take the \emph{average} over the squark colour states (see the squark-squark entry in the list above).

We will choose option b) and the code (\code{dsandwdcoscn}, \code{dsandwdcoscn}, \code{dsasdwdcossfsf} and \code{dsasdwdcossfchi}) should thus return $W'$ as defined above. Note again that squarks are assumed to have $g_i=6$ degrees of freedom in this convention and the summing over colours should also be taken into account in the code.

\subsection{Reformulation of the Boltzmann equation}

We now follow Gondolo and Gelmini \cite{GondoloGelmini} to 
put Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann2}) in a more convenient form by
considering the ratio of the number density to the entropy density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ydef}
  Y = \frac{n}{s}.
\end{equation}
Consider
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dY}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{n}{s} \right) = 
  \frac{\dot{n}}{s}-\frac{n}{s^2}\dot{s}
\end{equation}
where dot means time derivative. In absence
of entropy production, $S=R^3s$ is constant ($R$ is the scale factor).
Differentiating with respect to time we see 
that
\begin{equation}
  \dot{s} = -3\frac{\dot{R}}{R} s = -3Hs
\label{eq:entropycons}
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
  \dot{Y} = \frac{\dot{n}}{s} + 3H \frac{n}{s}.
\end{equation}
Hence we can rewrite Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann2}) as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Boltzmann3}
  \dot{Y} = -s  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle 
  \left( Y^2 - Y_{\rm{eq}}^2 \right).
\end{equation}

The right-hand side depends only on temperature, and it is therefore
convenient to use temperature $T$ instead of time $t$ as independent
variable. Defining $x=m_1/T$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dY}{dx} = - \frac{m_{1}}{x^2} \frac{1}{3H} \frac{ds}{dT}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle \left( Y^2 -
  Y_{\rm{eq}}^2 \right).
\label{eq:Boltzmann3bis}
\end{equation}
where we have used
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\dot{T}} = \frac{1}{\dot{s}} \frac{ds}{dT} = -
  \frac{1}{3Hs} \frac{ds}{dT} 
\end{equation} 
which follows from Eq.~(\ref{eq:entropycons}). 
With the Friedmann equation in a radiation dominated universe
\begin{equation}
  H^2 = \frac{8\pi G \rho}{3} ,
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, and the
usual parameterization of the energy and entropy densities
in terms of the effective degrees of freedom $g_{\rm{eff}}$ and
$h_{\rm{eff}}$, \begin{equation} \label{eq:geffheff}
  \rho = g_{\rm{eff}}(T) \frac{\pi^2}{30} T^4
  , \quad 
  s = h_{\rm{eff}}(T) \frac{2\pi^2}{45} T^3 ,
\end{equation}
we can cast Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann3bis})
into the form \cite{GondoloGelmini}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Boltzmann4}
  \frac{dY}{dx} = - \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{45G}} \frac{g_{*}^{1/2}m_1}{x^2}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle \left( Y^2 -
  Y_{\rm{eq}}^2 \right) 
\end{equation}
where $Y_{\rm eq}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
  Y_{\rm{eq}} = \frac{n_{\rm{eq}}}{s} = 
  \frac{45 x^2}{4 \pi^4 h_{\rm{eff}}(T)} \sum_i g_i
  \left( \frac{m_i}{m_1} \right)^2 K_{2} \left( x 
\frac{m_{i}}{m_1}\right),
\end{equation}
using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:neq}), (\ref{eq:ydef}) and
(\ref{eq:geffheff}).

The parameter $g_{*}^{1/2}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  g_{*}^{1/2} = \frac{h_{\rm{eff}}}{\sqrt{g_{\rm{eff}}}}
  \left( 1+\frac{T}{3h_{\rm{eff}}} \frac{d h_{\rm{eff}}}{dT}
  \right)
\end{equation}

For $g_{\rm eff}$, $h_{\rm eff}$ and $g_*^{1/2}$ we use the values
in Ref.~\cite{GondoloGelmini} with a QCD phase-transition
temperature $T_{QCD} = 150 $ MeV. Our results are insensitive to the
value of $T_{QCD}$, because due to a lower limit on the neutralino
mass the neutralino freeze-out temperature is always much larger
than $T_{QCD}$.

To obtain the relic density we integrate Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann4})
from $x=0$ to $x_0=m_\chi/T_0$ where $T_0$ is the photon temperature
of the Universe today. The relic density today in units of the
critical density is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \Omega_\chi = \rho_\chi^0/\rho_{\rm
  crit}=m_\chi s_0 Y_0/\rho_{\rm crit}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm crit}=3 H^2/8 \pi G$ is the critical density, $s_{0}$ 
is the entropy density today and $Y_{0}$ is the result of the 
integration of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Boltzmann4}). With a
background radiation temperature of $T_0=2.726$ K we finally obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:omegah2}
  \Omega_\chi h^2 = 2.755\times 10^8 \frac{m_\chi}{\mbox{GeV}} Y_0.
\end{equation}

%%%%% APPENDIX: Relic density - numerical details %%%%%

\section{Relic density -- numerical integration of the density equation}
\label{sec:numdens}

Let us write the evolution equation for the density,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Boltzmann4}
  \frac{dY}{dx} = - \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{45G}} \frac{g_{*}^{1/2}m_1}{x^2}
  \langle \sigma_{\rm{eff}} v \rangle \left( Y^2 -
  Y_{\rm{eq}}^2 \right) 
\end{equation}
as
\begin{equation} 
  \frac{dY}{dx} = \lambda (Y^2 - q^2),
  \label{eq:evol}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ contains the annihilation rate and $q$ represents the
thermal-equilibrium density.

This equation is stiff and an explicit method, like Euler or Runge-Kutta, fails
to converge. To obtain a numerical solution, we use an adaptive implicit
trapezoidal method which we explain in the following.  Basically we discretize
the equation first with a trapezoidal then with an Euler method, and adapt the
step size according to the difference in the updated function values.

For simplicity we denote the right hand wide of eq.~(\ref{eq:evol}) as $f(x)$.
We further write $f_{i} = f(x_i)$ and similarly for the other functions
$\lambda(x)$ and $q(x)$. Given $Y_{i} = Y(x_i)$ we find $Y_{i+1} = Y(x_{i+1}) $
with $x_{i+1} = x_{i} + h$ as follows.

First we discretize the evolution equation as
\begin{equation}
  Y_{i+1} - Y_{i} = h \frac{ f_i + f_{i+1}}{2} .
\end{equation}
We insert
\begin{eqnarray}
  f_{i} &=& \lambda_{i} \left( Y_{i}^2 - q_{i}^2 \right), \\
  f_{i+1} &=& \lambda_{i+1} \left( Y_{i+1}^2 - q_{i+1}^2 \right) ,
\end{eqnarray}
and solve the resulting quadratic equation for $Y_{i+1}$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:y_one}
  Y_{i+1} = \frac{c}{1+\sqrt{1+uc}} ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
c &=& 2 Y_{i} + u \left[ (q^2_{i+1} + \rho q^2_{i}) - \rho Y^2_{i} \right] , \\
u &=& h \lambda_{i+1} ,\\
\rho &=& \lambda_i / \lambda_{i+1} .
\end{eqnarray}
In the expression for $c$ we have explicitly indicated the order of evaluation
which we found avoids round-off errors. If in eq.~(\ref{eq:y_one}) $1+uc$ is
negative, we simply reduce the step $h$ to $h/2$ and try again.


Secondly we discretize the evolution equation as
\begin{equation}
  Y_{i+1} - Y_{i} = h f_{i+1} .
\end{equation}
We insert the expression for $f_{i+1}$ 
and solve the quadratic equation for $Y_{i+1}$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:y_two}
  Y'_{i+1} = \frac{1}{2} \, \frac{c'}{1+\sqrt{1+uc'}} ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  c' = 4 \left( Y_{i} + u q^2_{i+1} \right) .
\end{equation}
Again if in eq.~(\ref{eq:y_two}) $1+uc'<0$, we reduce the step $h$ to $h/2$ and
try again.

We then adapt the step size according to the relative difference of $Y_{i+1} $
and $Y'_{i+1}$,
\begin{equation}
d = \left| \frac{ Y_{i+1} - Y'_{i+1} }{ Y_{i+1} } \right| .
\end{equation}
If the difference is larger than a prefixed $\epsilon$, set at 0.01, we reduce
the step size $h$ to $hs/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ but never to less than $h/10$.  $s$
is a safety factor set to 0.9. If $d<\epsilon$, we increase the step size by a
factor $s/\sqrt{\epsilon}$ but never by more than a factor of 5.  We do not
allow the step size to become smaller than $h_{\rm min} = 10^{-9}$. Error code
5 is reported if this happens.  Error code 4 occurs when $x_{i+1}$ is
numerically equal to $x_{i}$ because of round-off. Error code 6 occurs when the
number of steps exceeds a maximum of 100000.  Finally the initial step size is
taken to be 0.01.

\section{Relic density -- routines}

In \ft{src/rd}, the general relic density routines are found. These
routines can be used for any dark matter candidate and the interface
to neutralino dark matter is in \ft{src/rn}. We will first discuss how
the routines for neutralino relic density are used and then how the
general routines work.

\subsection{Neutralino relic density}

\begin{sub}{function \ftb{dsrdomega}(coann,fast,xf,ierr,iwar,nfc)
\hfill r8}
  \itit{Purpose:} Calculate the relic density of the lightest
  neutralino, possibly including coannihilations between different
  neutralinos, neutralinos and charginos and between charginos.
  \itit{Input:}
  \itv{coann}{i} 
  =1: include coannihilations between
    neutralino--neutralino, neutralino--chargino and
    chargino--chargino.\\
  =2: do not include coannihilations.
  \itv{fast}{i}
  =1: Do a faster calculation, with slightly less accuracy in the
  numerical integrations and only including coannihilations (if
  \ft{coann=1}) with other particles up to 1.3 times heavier than the
  lightest neutralino.\\
  =2: Do a more accurate calculation, with higher accuracy in the
  numerical integrations and including coannihilations (if
  \ft{coann=1}) with other particles up to 2.1 times heavier than the
  lightest neutralino.
  \itit{Output:}
  \itv{xf}{r8} $x$ is defined as $x=m_\chi/T$ and \ft{xf} is the $x$
  at which freeze-out occurs (defined as the temperature at which the
  number density is a factor of two higher than the equilibrium
  density). \comment{Check!}
  \itv{ierr}{i} =0: Calculation went OK.\\
  $\neq0$: Somethig went wrong. \comment{Describe!}
  \itv{iwar}{i} =0: Calculation went OK.\\
  $\neq0$: A slight inaccuracy may have occured at a resonance or
  threshold for numerical reasons. Usually, this doesn't affect the
  result, but one should keep it in mind in case the returned relic
  density seems strange.
  \itv{nfc}{i} The number of points (in $p_{\rm eff}$) at which the
  cross section was evaluated.
\end{sub}

\begin{sub}{subroutine \ftb{dsrdwrate}(unit1,unit2,ich)}
  \itit{Purpose:} Writes a table of the partial
    annihilation rates $W_F(p,\cos\theta)$ into each final channel $F$ as a
    function of the center-of-mass momentum $p$ and at $\cos\theta=0.1$ to 
    \ft{unit2}. 
  \itit{Inputs:}

  \itit{Comment:} Only annihilation between the \emph{lightest}
    neutralinos and charginos are included.
\end{sub}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{General relic density routines}

The routine that performs the actual relic density calculation is
\begin{sub}{subroutines
\ftb{dsrdens}(wx,ncoann,mcoann,dof,nrs,rm,rw,nt,tm,oh2,tf,ierr,iwar)}
  \itit{Purpose:} Calculate the relic density of a dark matter
  candidte.
  \itit{Input:}
  \itv{wx}{r8} User-defined function that returns the effective

  times the equlibrium density.
  \itv{ierr}{i} =0: Calculation went OK.\\
    $\neq0$: Somethig went wrong. \comment{Describe!}
  \itv{iwar}{i} =0: Calculation went OK.\\
    $\neq0$: A slight inaccuracy may have occured at a resonance or
    threshold for numerical reasons. Usually, this doesn't affect the
    result, but one should keep it in mind in case the returned relic
    density seems strange.
\end{sub}
It is up to the user to prepare the input function and arrays
accordingly before calling the routine.

All internal settings of the relic density routines are set in common
blocks in \ft{dsrdcom.h}. The most important parameters that can be
changed by the user are

\begin{sub}{Important parameters in \ftb{dsrdcom.h}}
  \itit{Purpose:} Provide a set of parameters, with which the internal
  behaviour of the relic density routines can be changed.
  \itit{Parameters}
  \itv{tharsi}{i} Size of the coannihilation, resonance and threshold
    arrays (default=50). Increase this size if you have more than 50
    coannihilating particles, more than 50 resonances or more than 50
    thresholds.
  \itv{rdluerr}{i} Logical unit number where error messages are
    printed.
  \itv{rdtag}{c*12} Idtag that is printed in case of errors.
  \itv{cosmin}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{waccd}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{dpminr}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{dpthr}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{wdiffr}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{wdifft}{r8} \ldots
  \itv{hstep}{r8} \ldots
\end{sub}

When the relic density has been calculated, the integer variable \code{copart} in \code{dsandwcom.h} is set to indicate which coannihilating particles that have been included in the calculation. In Table~\ref{tab:copart}, the meaning if this variable is shown.

  quick-and-dirty method. It uses the approximative expressions in
  Kolb \& Turner with the cross section expaned in $v$.
\bsub{dsrdqrkck}
  To numerically integrate a function with a
  Runge-Kutta method
\bsub{dsrdrhs}
  To calculate terms on the right-hand side in the
  Boltzmann equation.

  cross section at a given temperature.
\bsub{dsrdthclose}
  ???\comment{What does this function do?}
\bsub{dsrdthlim}
  To determine the end-points for the thermal
  average integration.
\bsub{dsrdthtest}
  To check if a given entry in the $W_{\rm
  eff}$-$p_{\rm eff}$ table is at a threshold.
\bsub{dsrdwdwdcos}

\bsub{dsrdwintp}
  To return the invariant rate $W_{\rm eff}$ for any
  given $p_{\rm eff}$ by performing a spline interpolation in the
  $W_{\rm eff}$-$p_{\rm eff}$ table.

  eff}$-$p_{\rm eff}$ table and compare with a linear interpolation.
\bsub{dsrdwintrp}
  To write out a table of the invariant rate $W_{\rm
  eff}$ and some internal integration variables and expressions.
\bsub{dsrdwres}
  To write out the table $W_{\rm eff}$-$p_{\rm eff}$.
\end{brief-subs}

\section{mSUGRA (ISASUGRA) interface to DarkSUSY}

If \code{Isasugra} is available, \ds\ can use \code{Isasugra} to
generate mSUGRA models. In \codeb{src/rge/}, routines are avaible to
transfer the mSUGRA parameters from \ds\ to \code{Isasugra}, call
\code{Isasugra} and then transfer back the results to \ds. The
philosophy of this interface is that whenever a user uses
\code{Isasugra}, we should use all the results of \code{Isasugra} also
in \ds. That means that instead of calculating the mass spectrum from
the low-energy parameters obtained from \code{Isasugra}, we extract
the masses and mixings from \code{Isasugra}.

\label{ch:src-rn}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Relic density of neutralinos}

The relic density routines in \codeb{src/rd} solve the Boltzmann
equation for any cold dark matter particle and it is up to us to tell
it what kind of particles that can participate in coannihilations and
what the effective annihilation rate is. This set-up for neutralino
dark matter is done in \codeb{dsrdomega}. This routine is therefor the
main routine the user should call, when the relic density of
neutralinos is wanted. 

What it does internally is the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It determines which particles that can coannihilate (based on
    their mass differences) and puts these particles into a common
    block for the annihlation rate routines (\codeb{dsanwx}) and an
    array for the relic density routines. The relic density routines
    need to know their masses and internal degrees of freedom.
  \item It checks where we have resonances and thresholds and adds
    these to an array, which is passed to the relic density
    routines. The relic density routines then use this knowledge to
    make sure the tabulation of the cross section and the integrations
    are performed correctly at these difficult points.
  \item It then calls the relic density routines to calculate the
    relic density.
\end{itemize}

The returned value is $\Omega_\chi h^2$.

\label{ch:src-su}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Supersymmetric model}

We will here review the definition of the MSSM as given in \cite{dspaper}.

\subsection{Parameters}

In our notation, the superpotential and the soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar
potential minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with R-parity
conservation \cite{mssm} read respectively
\begin{eqnarray}
  W &=& \epsilon_{ij} \left(
  - {\bf \hat{e}}_{R}^{*} {\bf h}_E {\bf \hat{l}}^i_{L} {\hat H}^j_1 
  - {\bf \hat{d}}_{R}^{*} {\bf h}_D {\bf \hat{q}}^i_{L} {\hat H}^j_1 
  + {\bf \hat{u}}_{R}^{*} {\bf h}_U {\bf \hat{q}}^i_{L} {\hat H}^j_2 
  - \mu {\hat H}^i_1 {\hat H}^j_2 
  \right),
\\
  V_{{\rm soft}} & = & 
  \epsilon_{ij} \left(
    -{\bf \tilde{e}}_{R}^{*} {\bf A}_E {\bf h}_E {\bf \tilde{l}}^i_{L} H^j_1 
  - {\bf \tilde{d}}_{R}^{*} {\bf A}_D {\bf h}_D {\bf \tilde{q}}^i_{L} H^j_1 
  + {\bf \tilde{u}}_{R}^{*} {\bf A}_U {\bf h}_U {\bf \tilde{q}}^i_{L} H^j_2
  - B \mu H^i_1 H^j_2 
  \right. \nonumber \\ && \phantom{\epsilon_{ij} \Bigl(} \left.
  + {\rm h.c.} 
  \right) \nonumber \\ &&
  + H^{i*}_1 m_1^2 H^i_1 + H^{i*}_2 m_2^2 H^i_2
  \nonumber \\ && +
  {\bf \tilde{q}}_{L}^{i*} {\bf M}_{Q}^{2} {\bf \tilde{q}}^i_{L} + 
  {\bf \tilde{l}}_{L}^{i*} {\bf M}_{L}^{2} {\bf \tilde{l}}^i_{L} + 
  {\bf \tilde{u}}_{R}^{*} {\bf M}_{U}^{2} {\bf \tilde{u}}_{R} + 
  {\bf \tilde{d}}_{R}^{*} {\bf M}_{D}^{2} {\bf \tilde{d}}_{R} + 
  {\bf \tilde{e}}_{R}^{*} {\bf M}_{E}^{2} {\bf \tilde{e}}_{R} .
\end{eqnarray}
Here $i$ and $j$ are SU(2) indices ($\epsilon_{12} = +1$), ${\bf h}$'s, ${\bf
  A}$'s and ${\bf M}$'s are $3\times3$ matrices in generation space,
and the other boldface letters are vectors in generation space.
  
The current version of \ds\ uses only a restricted set of parameters.
Namely the number of free parameters (a grand total of 124 \cite{dimopoulos95})
is reduced by setting the off-diagonal elements of the ${\bf A}$'s and ${\bf
  M}$'s to zero and imposing CP conservation (except in the CKM matrix). 

\subsection{Mass spectrum}

For easy reference, we now give the particle mass matrices, together with our
convention for the mixing matrices.

Concerning the Higgs sector, we choose as independent parameters $\tan\beta$
and the mass $m_A$ of the CP-odd Higgs boson. The code provides six options
for the calculation of the Higgs masses: 
\ft{higloop}=0:  tree level formulas;
\ft{higloop}=1: the effective potential approach in
\cite{ellis91,brignole91} (correcting the sign of $\mu$ in eq.~(4) of
\cite{brignole91}); 
\ft{higloop}=2: the effective potential approach in \cite{drees92}
  with addition of D-terms and correction of some signs and numerical factors;
\ft{higloop}=3: the analytical approximations to the
  RGE-improved effective potential in \cite{carena95};
\ft{higloop}=4: the pole mass calculation in \cite{carena96};
\ft{higloop}=5: FeynHiggs (requires FeynHiggs to be
installed) \cite{feynhiggs};
\ft{higloop}=6: FeynHiggsFast (default) \cite{feynhiggsfast}.

The  masses of the Higgs bosons are obtained from
\begin{eqnarray}
&&  {\cal M}^2_{H} = 
  \left( \matrix{ 
      {m_Z^2 \cos^2\beta + m_A^2 \sin^2\beta + \Delta_{11} } &
      {-\sin\beta\cos\beta(m_Z^2+m_A^2) + \Delta_{12} }
      \cr
      {-\sin\beta\cos\beta(m_Z^2+m_A^2) + \Delta_{21} } &
      {m_Z^2 \sin^2\beta + m_A^2 \cos^2\beta + \Delta_{22} }
      } \right) 
  \\
&&  m^2_{H^{\pm}} = m_{A}^2+m_W^2 + \Delta_{\pm}.
\end{eqnarray}
The quantities $\Delta_{ij}$ and $\Delta_{\pm}$ are the one-loop
radiative corrections, calculated acording to the value of \ft{higloop} as
described above. Diagonalization of $ {\cal M}^2_{H} $ gives the two CP-even
Higgs boson masses, $ m_{H_{1,2}} $, and their mixing angle $\alpha$ ($ -\pi/2
< \alpha < 0$). For \ft{higloop}=4, the pole masses are then obtained solving
$ m^{2\rm pole}_{H_i} = m^2_{H_i} + \Pi_{ii}(m^{2\rm pole}_{H_i}) - \Pi_{ii}(0)
$, where $\Pi_{ii}(p^2)$ is $H_iH_i$ the self-energy. In this case, $m_{H_3}$
is the pole mass and $m_A$ is the running mass.

\caption{Higgs partial widths \code{hdwidth(i,j)}. Index \code{i} refers to the decay channel and index \code{j} to the Higgs boson. All widths are given in GeV\@. Note that typically we have that $m_{H_2}< m_{H_3}<m_{H^+}<m_{H_1}$ so many of these decay channels are not kinematically allowed, but included for completeness. If the \code{HDECAY} interface is used, the channels where $m_{H_2}< m_{H_3}<m_{H^+}<m_{H_1}$ is not satisfied are not included. Channels 16--19 are only included if HDECAY is used.}
\label{tab:hwidth}
\end{table}

The Higgs widths are calculated at tree level, but with QCD corrections \cite{higgsqcd}. The decays to supersymmetric particles are also included in the total width, so the sum of the partial widths in Table \ref{tab:hwidth} does not necessarily sum up to the total width given in \code{width(k)}. The loop corrections are also available via an interface to \code{HDECAY}.

  
The neutralinos $ \tilde{\chi}^0_i$ are linear combinations of the neutral
gauginos ${\tilde B}$, ${\tilde W_3}$ and of the neutral higgsinos ${\tilde
  H_1^0}$, ${\tilde H_2^0}$.  In this basis, we write their mass matrix as
\begin{eqnarray}
  {{\cal M}}_{\tilde \chi^0_{1,2,3,4}} = 
  \left( \matrix{
  {M_1} & 0 & -m_Z s_W c_\beta & +m_Z s_W s_\beta \cr
  0 & {M_2} & +m_Z c_W c_\beta & -m_Z c_W s_\beta \cr
  -m_Z s_W c_\beta & +m_Z c_W c_\beta & \delta_{33} & -\mu \cr
  +m_Z s_W s_\beta & -m_Z c_W s_\beta & -\mu & \delta_{44} \cr
  } \right) ,
\end{eqnarray}
with $c_W=\cos\theta_W$, $s_W=\sin\theta_W$, $c_\beta=\cos\beta$, and
$s_\beta=\sin\beta$.  Here $\delta_{33}$ and $\delta_{44}$ are radiative
corrections important when two higgsinos are close in mass. Their explicit
expressions are from ref.~\cite{drees97}. To neglect these radiative
corrections set \ft{neuloop}=0 instead of \ft{neuloop}=1 (default). The
neutralino mass eigenstates are written as
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\chi}^0_i = 
  N_{i1} \tilde{B} + N_{i2} \tilde{W}^3 + 
  N_{i3} \tilde{H}^0_1 + N_{i4} \tilde{H}^0_2 .
\end{equation}
The phases of $N_{ij}$ are chosen so that the neutralino masses
$m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_i} \ge 0$.


The charginos are linear combinations of the charged gauge bosons ${\tilde
  W^\pm}$ and of the charged higgsinos ${\tilde H_1^-}$, ${\tilde H_2^+}$.
Their mass matrix,
\begin{eqnarray}
  {\cal M}_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm} = 
  \left( \matrix{
  {M_2} & \sqrt{2} m_W \sin\beta \cr 
  \sqrt{2} m_W \cos\beta & \mu 
  } \right) ,
\end{eqnarray}
is diagonalized by the following linear combinations
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tilde{\chi}^-_i & = & U_{i1} \tilde{W}^- + U_{i2} \tilde{H}_1^- , \\
  \tilde{\chi}^+_i & = & V_{i1} \tilde{W}^+ + V_{i2} \tilde{H}_1^+ .
\end{eqnarray}
We choose ${\rm det}(U)=1$ and $U^* {\cal M}_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm}
V^\dagger = {\rm diag} ( m_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1},
m_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm_2} )$ with non-negative chargino masses $
m_{\tilde{\chi}^\pm_i} \ge 0$.

When discussing the squark mass matrix including mixing, it is
convenient to choose a basis where the squarks are rotated in the same
way as the corresponding quarks in the standard model.  We follow the
conventions of the particle data group \cite{pdg99} and put the mixing
in the left-handed $d$-quark fields, so that the definition of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is $\mbox{\bf K}= \mbox{\bf V}_1
\mbox{\bf V}_2^\dagger$, where $\mbox{\bf V}_1$ ($\mbox{\bf V}_2$)
rotates the interaction left-handed $u$-quark ($d$-quark) fields to
mass eigenstates.  For sleptons we choose an analogous basis, but due
to the masslessness of neutrinos no analog of the CKM matrix appears.
 
We then obtain the general $6\times6$ $\tilde{u}$- and
$\tilde{d}$-squark mass matrices:
\begin{equation}
  {\cal M}_{\tilde u}^2 = \left( \matrix{
      \mbox{\bf M}_Q^2 + \mbox{\bf m}_u^\dagger \mbox{\bf m}_u +
      D_{LL}^{u} \mbox{\bf 1} &
      \mbox{\bf m}_u^\dagger 
      ( {\bf A}_U^\dagger - \mu^* \cot\beta ) \cr
      ( {\bf A}_U - \mu \cot\beta ) \mbox{\bf m}_u &
      \mbox{\bf M}_U^2 + \mbox{\bf m}_u \mbox{\bf m}_u^\dagger +
      D_{RR}^{u} \mbox{\bf 1} \cr
      } \right),
  \label{mutilde}
\end{equation}

\end{equation}
and the general sneutrino and charged slepton mass matrices
\begin{equation}
  {\cal M}^2_{\tilde\nu} = \mbox{\bf M}_L^2 + D^\nu_{LL} \mbox{\bf 1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  {\cal M}^2_{\tilde e} =\left( {\matrix{

          D_{RR}^{e}\mbox{\bf 1}}\cr
        }} \right).
  \label{metilde}
\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}
  D^f_{LL}=m_Z^2\cos 2\beta(T_{3f}-e_f\sin^2\theta_w),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  D^f_{RR}=m_Z^2\cos 2\beta e_f\sin^2\theta_w.
\end{equation}
In the chosen basis, $\mbox{\bf m}_u$ = $\mbox{\rm diag} ( m_{\rm
u}, m_{\rm c}, m_{\rm t} )$, $\mbox{\bf m}_d $ = $\mbox{\rm diag}
(m_{\rm d}, m_{\rm s}, m_{\rm b} )$ and $\mbox{\bf m}_e $ = $
\mbox{\rm diag} (m_e,$ $ m_\mu, m_\tau )$.

The slepton and squark mass eigenstates $\tilde{f}_k$ ($\tilde{\nu}_k$
with $k=1,2,3$ and $\tilde{e}_k$, $\tilde{u}_k$ and $\tilde{d}_k$ with
$k=1,\dots,6$) diagonalize the previous mass matrices and are related
to the current sfermion eigenstates ${\bf \tilde{f}}_{L}$ and ${\bf
\tilde{f}}_{R}$ via ($a=1,2,3$)
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tilde{f}_{La} & = & \sum_{k=1}^6 \tilde{f}_k {\bf \Gamma}_{FL}^{*ka} , \\
  \tilde{f}_{Ra} & = & \sum_{k=1}^6 \tilde{f}_k {\bf \Gamma}_{FR}^{*ka} .
\end{eqnarray} 
The squark and charged slepton mixing matrices ${\bf \Gamma}_{UL,R}$,
${\bf \Gamma}_{DL,R}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}_{EL,R}$ have dimension
$6\times 3$, while the sneutrino mixing matrix ${\bf \Gamma}_{\nu L}$
has dimension $3\times3$.

This version of \ds\ allows only for diagonal matrices ${\bf A}_U$,
${\bf A}_D$, ${\bf A}_E$, ${\bf M}_Q$, ${\bf M}_U$, ${\bf M}_D$, ${\bf M}_E$,
and ${\bf M}_L$. This ansatz, while not being the most general one, implies the
absence of tree-level flavor changing neutral currents in all sectors of the
model. In this case, the squark mass matrices can be diagonalized analytically.
For example, for the top squark one has, in terms of the top squark mixing
angle $\theta_{\tilde{t}}$,
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{UL}^{\tilde{t}_1\tilde{t}} =
  \Gamma_{UR}^{\tilde{t}_2\tilde{t}} = \cos \theta_{\tilde{t}} ,
  \qquad
  \Gamma_{UL}^{\tilde{t}_2\tilde{t}} =
  - \Gamma_{UR}^{\tilde{t}_1\tilde{t}} = \sin \theta_{\tilde{t}} .
\end{equation}

Special values of the sfermion masses can be set with the parameters {\tt
  msquarks}, and \ft{msleptons}.  If \ft{msquarks}=\ft{msleptons}=0, the
sfermion masses are obtained with the diagonalization described above. If {\tt
  msquarks}$>$0 (or \ft{msleptons}$>$0), all squark masses are set to {\tt
  msquarks} (or all slepton masses to \ft{msleptons}).  Finally, if {\tt
  msquarks}$<$0 (or \ft{msleptons}$<$0), the squark (or slepton) masses are
set equal to the neutralino mass but never less than $|\ft{msquarks}|$ (or
$|\ft{msleptons}|$).  This is to provide the lightest possible sfermions
compatible with a neutralino LSP. In all of these cases, there is no mixing
  between sfermions.


The particle masses are available in an array \ft{mass($p$)}, where $p$ is the
particle code from table \ref{tab:2}. Similarly, particle decay width are
available as \ft{width($p$)}, but currently only the width of the Higgs bosons
are calculated, the other particles having fictitious widths of 1 or 5 GeV (for
the sole purpose of regularizing annihilation amplitudes close to poles).

\subsection{Three-particle vertices}

We define three-particle vertices \ft{gl($i$,$j$,$k$)}$=g^L_{ijk}$ and
\ft{gr($i$,$j$,$k$)}$=g^R_{ijk}$ as follows. We adopt the convention
that the order of the particles in the indices is the order in which
they appear in the corresponding lagrangian term, so the last particle
is always entering. If there are charged particles in the vertex, they
are both assumed positively charged, and the particle that exits the
vertex is indexed before the particle that enters.
\begin{itemize}
\item Three scalar bosons:
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm int} = g_{\phi_i\phi_j\phi_k} m_W \phi_i \phi_j \phi_k
\end{equation}
where $\phi_i$ is a Higgs or a Goldstone boson. In this case, \ft{gl}={\tt
  gr}=$g$. Available vertices are $\phi_i\phi_j\phi_k$ = $H^0_iH^0_jH^0_k$,
$H^0_iH^-H^+$, $H^0_iA^0A^0$, $H^0_iG^0G^0$, $H^0_iG^-G^+$, $H^0_iG^-H^+$,

%\end{equation}
%which corresponds to the vertex
\begin{equation}
i g_{V_1V_2V_3} \left[ (k_1-k_3)_\nu g_{\mu\lambda} + (k_3-k_2)_\mu
  g_{\lambda\nu} + (k_2-k_1) g_{\mu\nu} \right]
\end{equation}
with all momenta incoming and assigned as $V_1^\mu(k_1)$, $V_2^\nu(k_2)$ and
$V_3^\lambda(k_3)$. 
Available vertices are $Z^0W^-W^+$ and $\gamma W^-W^+$.

\item One scalar boson and two Dirac fermions:
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm int} = \phi \overline{\psi}_1 ( g^L_{\phi\psi_1\psi_2} P_L +
g^R_{\phi\psi_1\psi_2} P_R ) \psi_2
\end{equation}
Available vertices are $\phi\psi_1\psi_2$ = 

\item One vector boson and two Dirac fermions:
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm int} = V_\mu \overline{\psi}_1 \gamma^\mu
( g^L_{V\psi_1\psi_2} P_L + g^R_{V\psi_1\psi_2} P_R ) \psi_2
\end{equation}
Available vertices are $V\psi_1\psi_2$ = 

\item One scalar boson, one Dirac and one Majorana fermion:
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L}_{\rm int} = \phi \overline{\psi} 
  ( g^L_{\phi\psi\chi} P_L + g^R_{\phi\psi\chi} P_R ) \chi
\end{equation}
Available vertices are $ \phi\psi\chi$ = 

\item One vector boson, one Dirac and one Majorana fermion:
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L}_{\rm int} = V_\mu \overline{\psi} \gamma^\mu

\end{itemize}

%\begin{eqnarray}
%{\cal L}_{\rm int} & = & 
%V_\mu \bar{\chi} \gamma^\mu (g^L_{V\chi\psi} P_L + g^R_{V\chi\psi} P_R) \psi +

%\end{eqnarray}
%Here $V_\mu$ is a vector boson, $\chi,\chi'$ are Majorana fermions,
%$\psi,\psi'$ are Dirac fermions, and $\phi$ can be a neutral ($\phi^*=\phi$) or
%a charged scalar.

Explicit expressions for the coupling constants $g_{ijk}$ can be obtained
in~\cite{mssm}, with radiative corrections to trilinear scalar couplings in
\cite{haber97}. We have rederived from the superpotential all vertices we have
implemented.

Implemented vertices:  those listed above plus 
$Z^0W^\pm W^\mp $, $Z^0H^0_iH^0_i$, $W^\pm H^\mp A^0$,
$W^\pm H^\mp H^0_i$, $H^0_iW^\pm W^\mp $, $H^0_iZ^0Z^0$, $Z^0A^0H$,
$H^0_iA^0A^0$, $A^0ff$, $H^0_iff$, $Z^0ff$, $Z^0\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^0$,
$H^0_i\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^0$, $Z^0\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^0$,
$W^\mp\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^\pm$, $H^\mp\tilde{\chi}^0\tilde{\chi}^\pm$, $
\tilde{q}\tilde{g}q$, $\tilde{f}\tilde{\chi}^0 f$, $H^0_i\tilde{\chi}^\pm
\tilde{\chi}^\mp$, $A^0\tilde{\chi}^\pm \tilde{\chi}^\mp$ , $W^\pm f f'$,
$H^\pm f f'$, $\gamma W^\pm W^\mp$, $ \gamma H^\pm H^\mp$, $Z^0
\tilde{\chi}^\pm \tilde{\chi}^\mp$, $\gamma\tilde{\chi}^\pm \tilde{\chi}^\mp$,
$\gamma f f$, $GHH$, $GGH$, $G^\mp\tilde{\chi^0}\tilde{\chi}^\pm$.

In appendix \ref{app:feyn}, most of the Feynman rules and the explicit
expressions for the $g$'s are found.

\subsection{Accelerator bounds}

Accelerator bounds can be checked by a call to \ft{dsacbnd(p)}, where
\ft{p}=0 checks all implemented bounds, \ft{p}=1 leaves out the
bound from $b\to s\gamma$, and \ft{p}=2 checks only $b\to
s\gamma$. The accelerator bounds implemented in version 3.10.2 (July
1999) are listed in table \ref{tab:1}. The branching ratio ${\rm
BR}(b\to s\gamma)$ is calculated to 1-loop using the expressions in
ref.~\cite{bertolini91}, including or not including 1-loop QCD
corrections according to the switch \ft{bsgqcd} (=0 without, =1 with
[default]).

c  INPUT parameters: there are 3 CLASS of "input" parameters 
c  1) *** OPTION FLAG PARAMETERS (driven from input file) ***
c  =ICHOICE(1--10) (see suspect2_call.f for more explanations)
c
c 2)``Standard Model" parameters (not to be changed normally)
C ALFINV:   1/ALPHA(MZ): QED Coupling (at MZ scale, MSbar scheme)
c  ( reference latest value is ALFINV = 127.938 )
C SW2:       sin^2(theta)_W(MZ) in the MSbar scheme
c  (reference value: SW2= .23117 for MTOP =175 GeV) 
C ALPHAS:  VALUE FOR ALPHA_S(M_Z) (at the MZ scale)
c  (reference value: ALPHAS= .119 )
C MT:   TOP POLE MASS (reference value is MT= 174.3 GeV)
c MB:   BOttom pole mass (ref. value 4.62 GeV)
c MC:   Charm pole mass  (ref. value 1.4 GeV)
c
c  3) MSSM models physical parameters:
c  m0, m1/2, A0, tan(beta), sign(MU) in minimal SUGRA;
c  or arbitrary soft-breaking terms in non-universal models
c (see input file suspect2.in for more details and examples)
c|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
c  **** IMPORTANT: MU SIGN (AND OTHER) CONVENTIONS ***** :
c|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
c  1) WE DEFINE THE SUPERPOTENTIAL with the sign of MU conventions
c  as: W = MU (H_u . H_d) +.. =(def)= MU *eps(i,j) H^i_u H^j_d +..;
c   eps(1,2) = 1 = -eps(2,1)
c  where H_u, H_d are chiral (Higgs, Higgsinos)_u,d SUPERfields; 
c  2) WE DEFINE  the susy-breaking MU-term in the scalar potential
c  with the convention: V = B* MU eps(i,j) h^i_u * h^j_d (h_u,d are now
c  ordinary scalar fields, h_u=(h^1_u, h^2_u)=(h^{+}_u, h^0_u), 
c  h_d=(h^1_d, h^2_d)=(h^0_d, h^{-}_d)
c 
c   MU signs in relevant terms then follow as:
c  
c  -Sfermions: mixing terms =  m_LR = A_i - MU *(TBETA or 1/TBETA)
c  where A_i = A_b, A_tau or A_top
c  - Chargino:  +MU in mass matrix mixing terms
c  - Neutralinos:  -MU in mass matrix mixing terms;
c  - ALSO, Higgs potential minimization condition 
c  (radiative SU(2)xU(1) breaking) takes then the following form:
c  MZ^2/2 =(m1^2 - m2^2 * tbeta^2)/(tbeta^2 -1)
c   B* MU = (m1^2+m2^2)/2 * sin( 2 beta)
c  (where m1^2 =(m_phi_d)^2 +MU^2 +one-loop corrections
c         m2^2 =(m_phi_u)^2 +MU^2 +one-loop corrections )

c   OTHER RELEVANT CONVENTIONS :
c  3) sign of M1,M2,M3:  -M_i * Gbar G in Lagrangien (i.e.
c   ``normal" fermion mass signs), where G,Gbar are gaugino fields. 
c  4)  TGBETA = vu/vd (Q=MZ); (INPUT);
c  5)  v = sqrt(vu^2+vd^2) = 1/sqrt(2*sqrt(2)*GF) =174.** GeV
c    i.e. MW^2 = g2^2 * v^2/2 and there are NO 1/sqrt(2) 
c    factor in phi_u,d: <phi_u> = vu ; <phi_d> = vd

c
c  y(12) = (m_phi_u)^2  scalar phi_u "mass" term (in potential)

C  This program calculates the total decay widths and the branching 
C  ratios of the C Standard Model Higgs boson (HSM) as well as those 
C  of the neutral (HL= the light CP-even, HH= the heavy CP-even, HA= 
C  the pseudoscalar) and the charged (HC) Higgs bosons of the Minimal
C  Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). It includes:
C
C - All the decay channels which are kinematically allowed and which
C   have branching ratios larger than 10**(-4). 
C
C - All QCD corrections to the fermionic and gluonic decay modes.
C   Most of these corrections are mapped into running masses in a
C   consistent way with some freedom for including high order terms. 
C
C - Below--threshold three--body decays with off--shell top quarks
C   or ONE off-shell gauge boson, as well as some decays with one
C   off-shell Higgs boson in the MSSM. 
C
C - Double off-shell decays: HSM,HL,HH --> W*W*,Z*Z* -->4 fermions,
C   which could be important for Higgs masses close to MW or MZ.
C
C - In the MSSM, the radiative corrections with full squark mixing and 
C   uses the RG improved values of Higgs masses and couplings with the 
C   main NLO corrections implemented (based on M.Carena, M. Quiros and
C   C.E.M. Wagner, Nucl. Phys. B461 (1996) 407, hep-ph/9508343). 
C
C - In the MSSM, all the decays into CHARGINOS, NEUTRALINOS, SLEPTONS 
C   and SQUARKS (with mixing in the stop and sbottom sectors). 
C
C - Chargino, slepton and squark loops in the 2 photon decays and squark
C   loops in the gluonic decays (including QCD corrections).

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

P. Gondolo created \ds\ in 1994, took care of its organization,
arranged it for release, and prepared the documentation. He contributed
\cite{bergstrom96} the routines on the supersymmetric spectrum and mixing, the
original calculation of the neutralino relic density without coannihilations,
the direct detection rates and the accelerator bounds. P. Gondolo and J.
Edsj\"o \cite{edsjo97} included coannihilations in the relic density routines.
J. Edsj\"o contributed the package for the neutrino--induced muons from the Sun
and the Earth \cite{edsjo95+}, and organized the routines for annihilations in
the galactic halo, incorporating the code for the gamma-ray continuum by
himself, for the antiprotons \cite{bergstrom99} and the gamma-ray lines
\cite{bergstrom97+} by P. Ullio, and for the positrons by E.  Baltz
\cite{baltz99}. Finally, \ds\ includes adapted versions of (1)
routines by Carena, Quir\'os and Wagner on the Higgs boson masses, (2) routines
from CMLIB (URL: http://www.netlib.org), specifically \ft{dqagse} and its
dependencies, (3) routines from CERNLIB, specifically \ft{gpindp} by X and
\ft{gadap} by T. Johansson.
