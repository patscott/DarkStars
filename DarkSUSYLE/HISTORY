Version history for DarkSUSY
============================

====================================================== VERSION HISTORY

---------- Version: current (not tagged yet)

* First galprop interface added

* Now uses a configure script to set up the makefiles before compilation.
  It is now possible to install DarkSUSY in your favourite location (e.g.
  /usr/local). The default is to install in the DarkSUSY directory itself.

* Small fixes to the sfermion coannihilation routines (working, but not
  complete yet).

---------- Version 4.1.6:  April, 2006 ----------

* Cleaned up the earth density and composition routines.

* Added routines that calculate the electron density in the Earth as
  a function of the radius (needed for neutrino oscillation code)

---------- Version 4.1.5:  April, 2006 ----------

* Merged together different subversions. Added a cleaner way of adding
  coannihilating particles (everything is done in dsrdomega now).

* Small bug fixes in the relic density routines (rare infinite loops
  caught)

* A bug in the full numerical solar capture rates fixed (the rates were
  over-estimated by 6%).

* New standard solar model used: BS05(OP). Gives very good ageement
  with the old BP2000 model, but with about 1% higher capture rates.
  The new alternative solar model, BS05(AGS,OP) with new heavy element
  abundances is also available. This model give a 4% higher capture
  rate on Hydrongen, but lower (about 20%) on the heavier elements.
  However, it doesn't fit helioseismology as well, so we use the BS05(OP)
  as the default.

---------- Version 4.1.4:  December, 2005 ----------

* Started adding routines to get column densities etc in the Sun. These
  are then used by an external neutrino oscillation code.

---------- Version 4.1.2:  September, 2005 ----------

* Fixed a problem with sfermion coannihilations at very high masses.

* Changed artificial width of sparticles to work better with very high
  mass models.

---------- Version 4.1.1: November 17, 2004 ----------

* Fixed a bug which could cause the relic density routines to crash
  if the print level was set to print all information/error messages

---------- Version 4.1: June 8, 2004 ----------

* Small bugfixes, most of which were not imporant (the only exception
  being the scattering rates on Na-23 and the spin-dependent
  scattering rates on specific nuclei. Note that the scattering cross
  sections on protons and neutrons were not affected).

* The MSSM test models used by test/dstest.f have been updated to
  correspond to the benchmark models in the DarkSUSY paper,
  astro-ph/0406204.

---------- Version 4.00: February 19, 2004 ----------

* New public release

---------- Version 4.00-pre7: February 19, 2004 ----------

* Added direct detection on various nuclei

* Cleaned up the code

* Updated the test files in test/

---------- Version 4.00-pre3: February 17, 2004 ----------

* Added new J(Psi) routines in src/hm.

* Code partly cleaned up.

---------- Version 4.00-pre2: February 16, 2004 ----------

* Cleaned up the code a little bit.

* Added the latest dbar routines and new updated halo properties from Piero.

---------- Version 4.00-pre1: February 16, 2004 ----------

* Merged with Paolo's routines:
  - Galactic center routines (though without the correct thick
    source treatment) included.
  - Direct detection routines updated. Drees-Nojiri formulae can be
    used and rates on various elements can be calculated.
  - Bug fixes in muon g-2 routines
  - Rearrangment of routines for annihilation rates are rest in the halo
  - Bug fixe for the neutrino yukawas.
  - Better error handling for mass diagonlization.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta24: February 13, 2004 ----------

* Piero's new positron routines are included. They are tested against
  Ted's routines and for non-cuspy profiles they agree. For cuspy profiles,
  Piero's routines give larger fluxes due to the fact that these routines
  integrate the source over both r and z and does not approximate the source
  as uniform in z as is done in Ted's routines. We have verified that Piero's
  routines with the same approximation gives the same result as Ted's
  routines. The new routines are in src/ep_clump/ and share many of 
  the common block of Ted's routines.

* The diffusion parameters for positron model esu04 have been corrected.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta23: February 10, 2004 ----------

* New velocity distribution routines for Burkert and N03 (adiabsm)
  profiles

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta21: January 26, 2004 ----------

* The pbar routines are updated to also include the routines to create
  data files for the new propagation routines

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta20: January 21, 2004 ----------

* ep routines updated to use Piero's diffusion parameters through the
  option 'esu04'.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta19: January 21, 2004 ----------

* New halo routines implemented. The possibility to use the Burkert
 profile has been added. The diffusion parameters for pbar, dbar and eplus
 have also been updated.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta18: December 23, 2003 ----------

* A bug in the form factors for the Earth and the Sun numerical capture
  rates was fixed. For the Earth, this had little effect, but for the
  Sun, the fix is important.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta17: December 16, 2003 ----------

* Results of a new solar system diffusion with solar depletion are
  now implemented.

* A bug in the Sun and Earth capture rates was fixed. The affected
  Earth routine was by default not used, so the Earth capture
  rates were OK. The Sun capture rates were on the other hand over-
  estimated by about 25-30%.

* Isasugra version 7.69 can now be used for the mSUGRA RGE running.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta15: May 23, 2003 ----------

* The isasugra interface is trimmed to correctly identify unphysical
  models as such.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta14: May 21, 2003 ----------

* Isasugra version 7.67 is now implemented to use with DarkSUSY. Compared
  to the earlier version 7.64, full one-loop corrections are now
  included for the sparticle masses, which change these by up to 5%.
  The isasugra routines have been converted to double precision to
  make them more stable in e.g. the focus point region and the convergence
  criteria are tightened compared to the isasugra distribution.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta13: May 15, 2003 ----------

* The b -> s gamma routines have been updated to include higher order
  loop corrections in the SM and SUSY calculation. The accelerator bound
  routine has been updated to compare with the current world-average
  of BR(b-> s gamma).
* Anti-deutron fluxes have been added. 

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta12: January 22, 2003 ----------

* A missing factor of 1/2 (see Ullio et al, PRD66(2002)123502) in
  the annihilation rates for annihilation in the halo has been inserted.
  Routines returning expressions like N*(sigma v) are not affected;
  only the routines returning a resulting flux have been modified.
  In addition, the neutrino fluxes from the Sun and the Earth have
  not been modifed as these included the factor of 1/2 already.
* The antiproton routines have been modifed so that different
  pbtd.dat files are used for different propagation models.
 

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta11: December 11, 2002 ----------

* A few errors on the ISAUGRA interface have been fixed
* ISASUGRA version 7.64 is now used. We have converted this
  into double-precision and increased the convergence criteria
  from the default values to make it stable in e.g. the
  focus point region.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta10: October 10, 2002 ----------

* For extreme parameters, cancellation errors could occur for some
  sfermion coannihilation channels. This is now taken care of.
* On some systems (Sun), the anstau-efos routines wouldn't compile
  due to missed external declarations. This is now fixed (even though
  these routines are never used).
* A missing process sfmerion coannihilation process has been inserted
  (slepton + slepton* -> nu nu-bar with chi+ exchange)
* The routine dreal in contrib/feynhiggs commented out since it
  conflicts with the intrinsic dreal on some systems.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta9: October 3, 2002 ----------

* Changed the maximal momentum p that is used in the relic density
  routines. It is usually set to p_max ~ 26 m_x to cover a large
  integration region even for small x. Changed the maximum to
  15*m_x instead and itroduced an extrapolation in dsrdwintp. This
  avoids sampling the cross sections in regions which in rare cases
  are numerically unstable (large cancellation errors).
  It should not affect the results of the relic density calculation.
* Fixed a few bugs in the new higwid routine
* Changed name of two FeynHiggs routines that conflicted with common
  blocks in private DarkSUSY routines.
* Updated accelerator constraints to pdg2002 (approximately).
  The new routines are in dsacbnd4.f and are used as a default
  when dsacbnd.f is called. The old routines will be used if
  a call to dsacset('pdg2000') is made before the call to dsacbnd.f.

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta8: September 18, 2002 ----------

* QCD corrections to Higgs widths and vertices added. Bugs in
  Higgs widths routines fixed.
* Running couplings and masses implemented in a simple way.
* Interface to HDECAY available (call dshdecay to set widths
  from there instead. Currently masses are set as well, uncomment
  in src/xhdecay/dshdecay.f if not wanted).
* Bugs in some vertices with A-terms fixed (sign error).

---------- Version 3.14.05-beta7: July 12, 2002 ----------

* Sfermion coannihilations included.
* Bug in chargino-(up-squark)-(down-quark) vertex fixed (sign error)
* Interface to Isajet v7.63
* Interface to full FeynHiggs routines (v.1.2.2)
* Many small fixes and improvements here and there

---------- Version 3.14.03-beta: April, 2001 ----------

* On systems with long directory names there was a problem with reading
  the datafiles. The limit on the length of the directory names has
  now been increased.

---------- Version 3.14.02-beta: February 19, 2001 ----------

* A bug in the Z gamma expressions fixed.
* The rate in neutrino telescopes was not correct when the
  Damour-Krauss population of neutralinos was included (non-standard
  option) and the effect of the new population was significant. This
  is now fixed.
* The idtag flag is no longer set in dsgive_model.
* The MSSM contribution to the g-2 amplitude can now be calculated.
* A flag in pbset was not saved properly. This caused a problem
  with some compilers. This is now fixed.
* The accelerator bound on mh2 was incorrect. This is now fixed.
* The call to dswhwarn in dstest.f was incorrect. This is now fixed.
* Makefiles rewritten to work better on different platforms.

---------- Version 3.14.01-beta: September 15, 2000 ----------

* First public release.
