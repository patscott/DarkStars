The 'star_history' folder contains the Tioga files for making plots from
the standard log files generated by EZ.  By default these log files are
placed in the 'run' directory and have names like 'masses.log', 'power.log',
'burn.log', etc.

The file 'history.rb' can be loaded into Tioga to create plots from the logs.
If your log files are somewhere other than '../run', then you'll need to
edit history.rb accordingly.

Note that this is NOT for use while the logs are being written! It assumes
the run has completed and the entire history is available.  If you're interested
in seeing more about individual models or watching during the run, you can get
how-to details in 'star_profiles/README'.

To create all the pdfs automatically, run Ruby by entering 'ruby make_history_pdfs.rb'
to the shell.  The PDF's should appear in the 'history_out' folder.
