The 'star_profile' folder contains the Tioga files for making plots of
particular stellar models.  EZ writes the model information into files
with names like 'model_189.log' and, by default, places them in the
'run' directory along with the other log files.  The file 'path.txt' in
the star_profile directory tells the plotting code where to get the
model data; change this if you're putting them someplace other than 'run'.

The files 'profile1.rb', 'profile2.rb', etc., can be loaded into Tioga
to create plots for the corresponding profiles (1 is the first profile
created, 2 is the 2nd, etc.).  The 'profile_model.rb' file can be
edited to give the name of a particular model log file.

You can also watch the models as they are created by EZ.  The file
'status.rb' is set to show plots from the file '../run/EZ_status.log'.
This file is rewritten each time EZ writes a new line to the terminal
(every 5th model by default).  So if you refresh the plot while EZ is
running, you'll see the data for the most recently created model.  If
you are using the MAC GUI for Tioga, you can turn on automatic timed
refresh and sit back and watch the plot update!


a few notes regarding making movies of stellar evolution

First step is to create a set of log files:

   here's a way using demo2

   edit demo2.f
   
      in the Demo_2 subroutine
      
         pick your starting mass and initial Z
   
   	   WRITE_PROFILE_TO_MODELS = .TRUE.
   	
   	in Demo2_Before_Evolve
   	
      	set summary_cnt to how often want to save a model for the movie
      	for example, 
            summary_cnt = 20 ! save every 20th model for movie

   
   cd ~/EZ/run
   rm models/*.log
   ./mk
   ./rn
   ls models
   
   
Second step is to create pdfs, one per log file:
   
   cd ~/EZ/star_profile

   edit movie_batch.rb to set figure number in last line

   rm movie_out/*.pdf
   ruby < movie_batch.rb
   ls movie_out


Last step is to turn the pdfs into a movie.

   for mac, GraphicConverter is good for this (see Tioga Tutorial Animation).
   
   for linux one good choice is to use the convert tool from ImageMagick 
   and mencoder from mplayer.
